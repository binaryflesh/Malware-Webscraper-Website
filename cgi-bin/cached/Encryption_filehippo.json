On-the-fly encryption means that data are automatically encrypted or decrypted right before they are loaded or saved, without any user intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password or correct encryption key. Until decrypted, a TrueCrypt volume appears to be nothing more than a series of random numbers. The entire file system is encrypted (i.e., file names, folder names, contents of every file, and free space).\nThis software is highly recommended for securing data on laptops.\nTrueCrypt performs the following tasks:\n\nCreates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk.\nEncrypts an entire partition or storage device such as USB flash drive or hard drive.\nEncrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed (pre-boot authentication).\nEncryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly) and transparent.\nProvides two levels of plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password: 1) Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system.  2) No TrueCrypt volume can be identified (volumes cannot be distinguished from random data).\nEncryption algorithms: AES-256, Serpent, and Twofish. Mode of operation: XTS.\n\nPlease Note: According to the programs author, TrueCrypt is not secure because it could contain unfixed security issues, therefore you should download TrueCrypt only if you are migrating data encrypted by TrueCrypt.\nAs The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 you should migrate any data encrypted by TrueCrypt to encrypted disks or virtual disk images supported on your platform.\n"},

You can even combine them by common name part, via command line, and from the desktop if you so wish.\nKey features include:\r\n\nIntuitive interface.\nHighly configurable.\nCombine by folder or file name.\nEncrypt PDF Documents.\nCommand line option.\n\n\nPDF Combine has a crisp looking interface that is easy to navigate; all of the options are clearly marked, and most features are where you need them to be located.\nThe downside to PDF Combine is the fact that it does take some time to learn about all of the options available and how to use them best. Unfortunately, the Help document isn't very clear. If, however, you have some experience with similar applications then the learning curve should not be as steep as those without.\n"},

You can also do the reverse; send video from an Android and iOS mobile device and burn it immediately, thanks to the updated \"AirBurn\" feature.\nLike many other products in the Nero range, Nero 2016 Classic has support for geotagging, called \"Places\". That means media filmed on a smartphone, tablet or other compatible device can be organised by its location metadata.\nThe software has also been updated with a new look and feel. The brand new launcher is now organized into five sections: \"Manage & Play\", \"Edit & Convert\", \"Rip & Burn\", \"Backup & Rescue\", and \"Extras\".\nThe help section has also been improved in this version, with comprehensive guides to walk you through the process of managing content and completing projects.\nWhile Nero 2016 Classic is a slimmed down version of its big brother, it still has support for cloud storage in various ways. Nero BackItUp is essentially a storage service that lets you access and play back content from anywhere. Media is organised by date in MediaHome, Nero's content manager, and segmented according to media type as well.\nNero 2016 Classic, also houses some really cool modules. Nero Recode, for example, rips disc contents or regular audio and video files, and converts them to a particular format, to play on a certain device, or burn them to disc. Nero Burning ROM is again at the the core of the package; burning CDs, DVDs or Blu-rays. With it, you can optionally encrypt your content or split it across multiple discs. If you run the suite on a dual monitor system, then you'll be able to preview your content full-screen on the second display as well.\nThe downside of Nero 2016 Classic, is you lose the ability to play back Ultra HD (4K). Otherwise, apart form extra content and video effects and the \"stashimi\" recorder, the main difference between this and the Platinum suite is the price tag.\n"},

From Box to Yandex and everything in between, it seems as though everyone has jumped on board with storing their data in a cloud environment. Everyone except the ultra security conscious, that is. If you categorize yourself in that bracket, then you should definitely check out Boxcryptor.\r\n\n\r\nMore and more people are getting to grips with extra levels of security in \u2018secure\u2019 applications and services. Boxcryptor is a next-gen 'on disk' encryption tool that aims to do just that.\r\n\n\r\nThe service works by taking files that are stored in cloud locations and it encrypts them using AES-256 and RSA encryption algorithms to secure the data. To set up Boxcryptor, simply install the app, choose which cloud platforms to encrypt and select filename encryption (not available in the free version). As soon as any new files are stored on the Boxcryptor drive, they are automatically encrypted. To encrypt any existing files, just right click on the files in Explorer or Finder and enable encryption. To unlock the Boxcryptor folder and view your files, all you have to do is simply run the BoxCryptor app, navigate to the encrypted folder and enter your password.\r\n\n\r\nBoxcryptor supports almost all cloud storage providers:  Google Drive, One Drive, One Drive Business, Dropbox, Box, Amazon S3, CloudMe, iCloud, SugarSync, and Yandex to name a few.\r\n\n"},

This basically means that your activity remains private \r\n\r\nwithout changing the way you use your computer or restricting your online activities.\nIt defeats key-loggers by encrypting your keystrokes at the keyboard driver level. If a key-logger does manage to record your keystrokes, they will only \r\n\r\nbe able to record the encrypted keys that are, obviously indecipherable.\nAs KeyScrambler Personal mostly works in the background, you will normally not notice it in operation. It does, however, have an intuitive interface \r\n\r\nthat provides you with easy access to all of the application's features: When you start typing in a supported browser, you can see a banner at the top of \r\n\r\nyour active window, which shows the encrypted text as you are typing. If you right-click on the tray icon, it allows you to open the Options menu. This is \r\n\r\nwhere you can do things like set a hotkey for turning the application on and off etc.\nOverall, KeyScrambler Personal is a good tool for evading key-loggers, and it does not interfere with your daily use of other applications on your \r\n\r\ncomputer.\n"},

The entire file system is encrypted (i.e., file names, folder names, contents of every file, and free space).\nThis software is highly recommended for securing data on laptops.\nTrueCrypt performs the following tasks:\n\nCreates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk.\nEncrypts an entire partition or storage device such as USB flash drive or hard drive.\nEncrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed (pre-boot authentication).\nEncryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly) and transparent.\nProvides two levels of plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password: 1) Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system.  2) No TrueCrypt volume can be identified (volumes cannot be distinguished from random data).\nEncryption algorithms: AES-256, Serpent, and Twofish. Mode of operation: XTS.\n\nPlease Note: According to the programs author, TrueCrypt is not secure because it could contain unfixed security issues, therefore you should download TrueCrypt only if you are migrating data encrypted by TrueCrypt.\nAs The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 you should migrate any data encrypted by TrueCrypt to encrypted disks or virtual disk images supported on your platform.\n"},
