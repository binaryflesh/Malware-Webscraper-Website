We can do absolutely nothing about this issue. The only solution is to root your device and change permissions (for example: http://technofaq.org/posts/2014/04/fixing-external-sd-card-write-issue-on-android-kitkat ) or upgrade to Android 5+ and use SAF mode.Alternatively - Create the following directory (on your external SD card):Android/data/com.paranoiaworks.unicus.android.sseThe app should have write permissions in this folder.\n"},

This app uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to encrypt text, so far the only working way of breaking AES without knowing the secret key is by brute force which can take up to a few billion years for a good password.If you want to read an encrypted text message you should first know the secret key and the key length(128, 192 or 256), without knowing them you can't decrypt the ciphertext and read it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------USAGE:The usage of this app is pretty straightforward, however two things are worth mentioning:1. CHANGING THE KEY LENGTH is done by pressing the \"AES-###\" button at the top of the app, where ### is the bit length of the secret key, it can be set to 128, 192 or 256. Different key sizes encrypt text differently even with the same key.2. PASTING TEXT\u00b3 can be done simply by long pressing the text field.*You can encrypt text with this app multiple times using different secret key and key size.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DISCLAIMER:1. The developer of this app distances himself from the contents of the encrypted messages made by its users. Using any kind encryption for criminal activity is illegal. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) also known as Rijndael developed by the Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen is the most widely used symmetric-key encryption algorithm today and is available for free use in many apps.2. In case of a published practical cryptographic \"break\" faster than a brute force against AES, the developer of this app must change the encryption algorythm within a week, however the developer will not be responsible for any previous encrypted messages that can be broken.3. The developer of this app is not responsible if a ciphertext is somehow decrypted using the secret key (or the same bitstream) by an unwanted third party, the secret key can be uncovered in multiple ways for example using a malicious software (keylogger) or being leaked by one of the original users. So far the fastest method of breaking an AES ciphertext, having only the ciphertext, is a brute force attack, so using strong passwords is highly recommended.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOTE_1: The text can be written in any language and in any alphabet that is widely used today, all Unicode/UTF-8 characters can be used.NOTE_2: The key also accepts all Unicode/UTF-8 characters, the strength of the secret key is determined by its length and the variety of different characters that are being used.NOTE_3: Pasting the ciphertext into the text field is the recommended way of inputting a ciphertext. Simply copy the text message from the SMS or any other app.NOTE_4: Encrypt text with this app and enjoy safe communication with you friends and colleagues.\n"},

If you ever lose phone, you won't lose your notes to thieves.FAQ -Q: Why not use XYZ app with application lock?A: Application locks prevents user from opening application, but does not secure the storage. Hence adversary can simply access the storage file directly and read the content. Using encryption is proper secure way to keep sensitive information safe.Q: If someone connects phone to computer and copies/read the data file storing all the notes, can't they read everything?A: They can't. No one can, regardless how they access the data file (unless they have your secret password). The application uses a technique called encryption. Encryption uses your password to convert notes to unreadable form which makes no sense to anyone even computer. This can be converted back to readable text only using exact same password.Q: I forgot my password. How do I recover my notes?A: You can't. Your password is not stored anywhere but in your brain. If you lose your password, you will lose all your notes. Storing password locally or on server is a security hole which should be avoided.Q: I can't take screenshots from app or I see blank screenshot in application switcher. What's wrong?A: You probably have enabled \"Secure Window\" feature in SealNote settings. Disable it to be able to take screenshots or show window content in application switcher.ContactHomepage: www.twistedplane.comEmail   : [email\u00a0protected]File bug reports at Github https://github.com/vishesh/sealnote/issues or email at above address with [Sealnote][BUG] tags in subject.\n"},

So even if the device is lost or stolen, it is not possible to access your confidential data.Encrypting new files is very simple: they can be chosen either with the built-in file manager or by simply using \"send/share\" from another app.Features:* Access based on master pin or master text password.* Encrypts all kind of files.* Possibility to encrypt all files of a folder.* Provides a special handling for images, e.g. removal/creation of gallery thumbnail images.* Base functionality of a file manager (view on click, send/share menu), but with automatic decryption before the action.* Offers AES and Twofish encryption with 128 and 256 bit keys.* Displays icons to indicate whether a file is currently decrypted or was changed.* User setting for automatic re-encryption on exit.* Secure overwrite of the orginal file after the encryption.* An additional anti file recovery tool is included.* Two layout modes: flat list view or hierarchical folder view.* Filters can be defined to filter SD card files by file extensions or to excluded folders.* The master password can be changed for an existing database.* Provides a comfortable backup mechanism for using cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, ...) to save the encrypted files* The app can be configured to delete all managed files after 7 unsuccessful attempts.* Has an \"Exit\" menu on all screens, that finishes the task completely.* App is locked (master password must be re-entered), when there is no user input for configurable period.* Includes english help pages.Languages:* English* German* French* Russian* SpanishLimitations:* The \"lite\" version is limited to 5 encrypted files!* The full version has no limitations.Keywords: file encryption, data encryption, file manager, crypto, SD card, encryption algorithm, AES, Twofish, backup\n"},

This SMS/Text shows up in your notification area and is there for everybody to see. Awkward!!With this app you can encrypt your messages with either a custom password or a default password and then send it. At the other end using this app the encrypted text can be decrypted using the same password or the default password.Note that the receiver needs to have this app installed and also should know the password to decrypt the message.Features:*Encrypt and decrypt text with a password*Quickly Copy / Share the encrypted/decrypted message via any app on your device that accepts simple text such as messaging app, email apps, etc*Use Default Password button to encrypt messages quickly. With the default password you don't have to share the password with the receiverHow to use the app:Encryption:Open the appType the message in the text window. You can also paste the message if you have copied it from another app (Long press and click paste)You can clear the message anytime by pressing the \"Clear\" button (left)Press the Encrypt Button (center)Password will be promptedEither enter a password or click on \"Default password\" to use the default passwordIf you entered a password, then you will have to confirm the password. This is to avoid any mistakes while entering the password.Renter the password and press okThe message will be encrypted and displayedYou can copy the encrypted message by pressing the \"Copy\" button (center)Or you can share the message by pressing the \"Share\" button (right)You can review the original message by pressing the \"Left Arrow\" button (left) and come back to this screen by pressing the \"Right Arrow\" buttonDecryption:Open the appIf the encrypted message was copied from another app, then you will be prompted to paste itYou can either click \"Paste\" to paste it or \"Cancel\" to enter the encrypted text manuallyIf you cancelled by mistake then you can still paste the message by long press and pasteYou can clear the message anytime by pressing the \"Clear\" button (left)After entering/pasting the encrypted text, press the \"Decrypt\" button (center)You will be prompted for a password; you should have received the password from the sender by any other means.Enter the password or click \"Default\" password if the sender did the same.The message will be decrypted and displayedYou can copy the decrypted message by pressing the \"Copy\" button (center)Or you can share the message by pressing the \"Share\" button (right)You can review the original message by pressing the \"Left Arrow\" button (left) and come back to this screen by pressing the \"Right Arrow\" buttonFAQ:Q: What is \"Default Password\".A: While encrypting a message, if you use the \"Default Password\" then a password known to the app will be used as the password. This is useful when you can't be bothered to enter a password and communicate this password to the receiver. The receiver also need not bother to enter the password but simply click the \"Default Password\" to decrypt the message. This is very useful when you know that the encrypted message will be received by the intended receiver only. The disadvantage of this is that anybody with this app who receives the encrypted message can decrypt it without a password.****NOTE**** This app is NOT meant for highly secure encryption purposes. Even though encryption method used is strong it is certainly not fool proof. If you are looking to encrypt highly confidential data then please DO NOT use this appPermissions Explained:* Network Communication: Required to display Ads (This is the only way we can support our development work)\n"},

We will be more than happy to explain.I am starting this project since I have tried a number of Apps for encrypted hidden file storage, while not finding one that best suits my expectations:- some do not encrypt videos securely and just stores the un-encrypted file- most only support hiding pictures and videos. I occasionally want to encrypt word documents but can't find a way.- some produced by major software companies are simply bloated and litters temp files everywhere...

App features:  * 128-bit AES encryption using:   - SecureRandom() with 'SHA1PRNG' salt   - SecretKeyFactory() with 'PBEWithSHAAnd128BitAES-CBC-BC'   - Cipher() with 'AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding'  * User-supplied cipher key(s) up to 12 characters long     * No-limit recursive encryption     * Any character set (language) can be encrypted*  * No app restrictions to data manipulation size  * SQLite database for archiving (with search and sort)  * 'Share' and Clipboard-paste for forwarding  * Scrollable real-time 'on screen' Event Log    * Built-in Help file  * Note: This free version permits only 5 'folders' in the database By using other Android apps, your encrypted data can be posted on the Web or transmitted to other Android devices around the globe. The destination receivers would use their own Crypt2phile app (see note below) and your previously-disclosed encryption key(s) to decipher the forwarded message.If you don't distribute your cipher texts, then you can save them in a SQLite database on your own Android smartphone. The information is stored in 'folders' where it can later be individually retrieved and decrypted to reveal your old confidential notes. (A maximum of 5 'folders' are permitted with this free app.)NOTES: If you discover you need more than 5 'folders', download the app: Cryptxphile. The tablet-targeted CryptxHD and CryptxHDx apps, and the smartphone-targeted Cryptxphile and Crypt2phile apps may all be used to decrypt any AES+ data file. Be aware that Triple-DES strings can not be decrypted by the AES algorithm, and vice versa.   Caveat: Mix together enough mathematicians, cryptographers, CPU's, and research time in a computer lab and you'll discover any encrypted text on planet Earth can be deciphered. Therefore, don't expect to find an \"uncrackability\" guarantee with this app! But by combining an off-the-shelf encryption algorithm with multiple private keys and unlimited recursion, hackers will be repulsed from even attempting to brute-force-attack your ciphered texts.* Note1: the Unicode characters x2500-x256C are reserved for data encoding!Note2: This app uses the \"menu\" button...which is likely missing on the newer models of tablets and smartphones! Check which your device manufacturer (via a Google search) to find out how this button is now simulated.\n"},

It can encrypt/ decrypt messages using  AES. This app DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY PERMISSIONS  and is COMPLETELY FREE OF ADVERTISEMENTS. You can be sure that the app does what it promises . The crack resistitvity of an AES  depends on the password length and complexity. The app warns if the user does not selects a password with min 6 characters having atleast one uppercase letter, one lower case, one special character and one digit.Text Encryptor is a Text Encryption application  that allows you to protect your privacy while communicating with friends. It allows you to encrypt/decrypt text messages using Advance Encryption Standard(AES) with a 256 bit (key length).The system computes the 256 bit key from the password string using SHA-256. The system uses Cipher  Block Chaining method (CBC) to encrypt the message in blocks of 128 bits. Block cipher modes for symmetric-key encryption algorithms require plain text input that is a multiple of the block size (ie 128 bits for AES), so messages may have to be padded to bring them to this length. The padding being used is PKCS5Padding. In CBC Explicit Initialization Vectors technique is being used wherein we  prepend a single random block to the plaintext. Encryption is done as normal, except the IV does not need to be communicated to the decryption routine. Whatever IV decryption uses, only the random block is \"corrupted\". This block is discarded and the rest of the decryption is the original plaintext.Electronic Codebook(ECB) block cipher method option has also been given. In ECB the message is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted separately.The disadvantage of this method is that identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks; thus, it must not be used with a non-random  and repetitive data. The ECB mode is deterministic. ECB option is only for academic purpose.Test Mode. AES test values (taken from FIPS-197) are:Key: 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f Plaintext: 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeffCiphertext: 8ea2b7ca516745bfeafc49904b496089Encrypting the plaintext with the key should give the ciphertext, decrypting the ciphertext with the key should give the plaintext. You can test the encryption online by using the test values at http://extranet.cryptomathic.com/aescalc/indexTo test select the mode as ECB on the website and use the above test values. To test for anyother value of Key and data , ensure that the data is exactly 16 Hex (16x8=128 bits) characters long. The key should be 32 Hex characters (32x8=256 bits) long. The mode selected in the android application should be \"Testing with No Padding\". You would observe that the result matches exactly. You can check SHA-256 conversion of the password online at  http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculatorIncase of any issues, feel free to write to me at[email\u00a0protected]PSSome good links to learn cryptography process being used in the app are as underAEShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL1ApwEXrz0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayiOhApI6SMBlock Ciphers, Why not use ECB?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0pREiDO7_ghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipherUTF-8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLBtrd9Ar28\n"},

The reason he could not import the keys was that he didn't understand the difference between private keys and certificates and kept on trying to import a .pfx file with the certificate import wizard (which is only for importing certificates, not keys). Paula reported that she couldn't find any certificates. CipherMail cannot \"automagically\" find all externally used certificates. There are three ways to get certificates for recipients: extracted from digitally signed email, manual import or, a certificate can be downloaded from an LDAP server.About the integration of CipherMail and email clients. CipherMail registers itself as an application to handle S/MIME attachments (smime.p7m). If a mail application can download the smime.p7m attachment, it can be decrypted by CipherMail. Most Android email clients cannot be extended by external apps. Improved integration between existing email clients and CipherMail can only be done if the email client supports plugins.About CipherMail:CipherMail (formerly known as DJIGZO), based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, provides products for the protection of email. CipherMail Email Encryption Gateway is an open source centrally managed email server that encrypts and decrypts email at the gateway level.Installation packages are available for Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, CentOS etc. A free ready to run Virtual Appliance for VMware and Hyper-V is available.\n"},

By having a simple and intuitive interface it achieves a consistent look and feel on any system, allowing you to get right down to securing your data.At its core it uses free libraries to provide a large collection of algorithms to choose from, many of which were finalists for the AES competition.The following cryptographic algorithms are currently supported on both desktop and Android systems: AES (and other Rijndael variants up to 256 bits), Serpent (128, 192 and 256 bit variants), Blowfish (128 bit) and Twofish (128 and 256 bits), as well as (Triple) DES.And the following one-way hash algorithms are common to all systems: TIGER, SHA1, the SHA2 variants (256, 384 and 512 bits), and MD5.In an effort to make encrypt even more useful to even more people, it&apos;s been written to use the compatible encryption libraries by the GNU Project: libgcrypt and gnu-crypto. This allows many different algorithms to be chosen from on both Android devices and desktop systems.The permissions requested are READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, and WAKE_LOCK; obviously you need the first two if you want to encrypt/decrypt files stored on your device, and the wake lock stops the OS putting encrypt to sleep before it&apos;s finished.For more information visit https://albinoloverats.net/projects/encryptThis is the free (ad supported) version - it has all of the same features and abilities as the paid for version, but with the addition of adverts.\n"},

Oversec introduces \"Eye-to-Eye\" encryption. Encrypted data is only decrypted while it is shown on the screen! No clear text is ever persisted and thus cannot be extracted from the file system or accidentally be backed up into the cloud.We also carefully designed Oversec so that it doesn't require internet access. Because of that, you can rest assured that no decrypted information can ever leave your device.How it works:Oversec constantly monitors the text on your screen. When it finds an encrypted text, it tries to decrypt it and then shows the decrypted text as an overlay in place of the encrypted text. Conversely, it can read text out of an input field, encrypt it, and then put the encrypted text back into the input field.In order to encrypt a text, Oversec shows a button next to an active input field. After having entered the secret text, tapping that button makes Oversec read the text, encrypt it and put back the encrypted text into the field. It is now ready to be sent in the subjacent app as usual - the app doesn't even know that it is sending encrypted data!Oversec also features a unique way of encoding the encrypted messages. It stores the encrypted text in invisible (zero-width) characters and let's you add decoy text at the end. That way, a message will just show e.g. \"The sun is shining!\" with no visible sign of any encryption, whereas in reality it contains a hidden encrypted message.You may also encrypt and send photos through Oversec - its unique camera mode even allows you to take and send an encrypted photo without ever storing the original photo on the device.Oversec encrypts your data either using symmetric keys  (using ChaCha20 cipher + Poly1305 MAC ) or using asymmetric PGP encryption (making use of the OpenKeychain app [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain]).The encryption related code is open source and can be found here: https://github.com/oversecio/oversec_crypto\nOversec for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

Even the choice of Favorite Category is encrypted.\u2022 Encrypts data using AES and Blowfish algorithms with key sizes of 256, 192 and 128 bits. And also supports Triple DES with key sizes of 168 and 112 bits.\u2022 When the data file is decrypted, up to all combinations of algorithm, key size and cipher mode of operation (CBC, CFB, OFB and ECB) are tried with the Master password to unlock the data file. This was inspired by TrueCrypt and makes brute force attacks longer. The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher, key size or cipher mode of operation.\u2022 Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\u2022 The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\u2022 Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.\u2022 Unlike other similar Android apps aWallet has no internet access permission (forever). The only permissions this app has is to access to the USB device to backup/restore the data file in case you lose your phone. USB device access is also needed to export to CSV file format. Permission is also granted to the Google Play billing service to allow for the optional purchase of the aWallet Pro features.For more info see http://www.awallet.org/If you like this App, rate it in the Google Play.

encryption App)\nA person who has a secret is an essential item!It is a very simple text encryption tool (cryptogram creation) tool.It is very safe because it applies a password (key) to each ciphertext with a super strong encryption algorithm.\u25c6 Background \u25c6Even in applications that are used conveniently by smartphones etc., accounts are easily hijacked, the contents are stolen and valuable information leaks and it is an era that is becoming a social problem.If not, it would be better to think about the exchange of messages via the Internet on the premise that everything is seen.Why do not you take measures to protect yourself by yourself soon?After the information that I want to keep secret has leaked to the outside, it can not be recovered any more.\u25c6 How to use \u25c6\u00b7 In the entry field on the \"Encryption\" tab, enter the text you want to keep secret (no limit of number of characters)When entering a password in the entry field at the upper left of the screen and pressing the \"execute\" button at the upper right of the screenEncrypted characters (ciphertext) are displayed.In the case of\u00b7 Paste the ciphertext in the input field of \"Decryption\" tab,When entering a password in the entry field at the upper left of the screen and pressing the \"Run\" button at the upper right of the screenThe decrypted message (plane text) is displayed.* Naturally, it can not be decrypted unless the password (key) multiplied by the ciphertext matchesPlease do not forget the password of the encrypted keyEven if a password is known by any chance, of course it can only be deciphered with this application(Well it's impossible to say absolutely, so if you take a Brute force attack etc, it will be decoded in a few years ...)\u00b7 The number of characters to put in the password is 4 to 16 characters (one pictogram is counted as 4 characters).You can use numbers, English, double-byte characters, symbols or pictograms all together.In the case of\u00b7 Encrypted ciphertext or decrypted message can be shared with others (by LINE, mail, etc.).You can also send and decrypt ciphertexts received by other applications such as LINE to this application.* When sharing cipher text with other people, I think that it is better to share the password (common key) with other routes (letters, telephone, sign language, Morse code, etc.) for safety.\u25c6 For example it may be useful for\u00b7 For people who want to exchange secrets of only two people who do not want to be seen by anyone \u2661Let's share only two people's ciphertext with a message application such as LINE or Messenger\u00b7 To those who want to lock a diary of yourself who you do not want to see\u2192 Record your own ciphertext in notebook applications such as Evernote or OneNote\u00b7 For those who need to protect confidential information only within the company\u2192 Share ciphertexts only within teams within the group of message applications\u00b7

NEW: 256-bit encryption now available and compatible in Android and WP7 versions.Secret Message Elite now combines the functionality of message encryption and image file encryption, so you can encrypt text and photos all from one app! Email, SMS, Tweet or post on Facebook secret messages between friends, co-workers, lovers using this simple application that encrypts a given text with a given key/passcode, and just as easily decrypts a given text with the same key. AES cipher algorithm is used to secure the message, resulting in very sound communication encryption that helps you keep your private conversations safe from prying eyes. Agree on a secret key. Write it. Encrypt it. Email it. SMS it. Post it on Facebook or Twitter! Here&apos;s how you use it:1. Agree on a secret key with your friend/co-worker/lover/cat.2. Enter your message.3. Click &apos;Encrypt&apos;.4. And then send your encrypted/encoded message. You can: - Email it.- SMS/Txt it.- Share any other way you want: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.Message encryption or decryption not working? Always make sure that you have the latest (most up-to-date) version of the app. Also make sure you and the other person both use the same encryption mode (128 or 256-bit). Still not working? Please tell us - [email\u00a0protected]FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:Q: Why does this app require all these permissions?A:Different permissions are necessary for different parts of the app to function properly. Some more commonly asked about permissions are briefly explained below: * WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - necessary for image file encryption/decryption, and storage.* PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS - necessary for Stealth Mode feature to work. App gets activated when 3666 is dialed. No other number is intercepted.Q: What is Stealth Mode? A: While in Stealth Mode the app is not visible in the app list (drawer). There is no open button; The only way to launch Secret Message is to dial \"3666\" and press the call button.Q:What are Salt & Iteration options in Settings menu? A: These are relevant only for 256-bit encryption. If you&apos;re not familiar with these cryptography terms, read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography) Q: Is 128 and 256-bit encryption compatible? A: No, if you encrypt something with 256-bit option enabled, no one will be able to decrypt using 128-bit version (or vice versa).Q: Once the person receives the encrypted message how do they decrypt it? A: The receiver of your encrypted message has a couple of options when it comes to decrypting and reading your message:1. Copy the encrypted message itself and paste it into their Secret Message app on their iPhone, iPad, Android device or Windows Phone 7 mobile device. This obviously requires the other party to also have Secret Message installed on their phone.2. If sent via email or Facebook wall post, a link should&apos;ve been generated for a web page which can help the other person decrypt the message. For example, try this link: http://www.secretmessageapp.com/decrypt/a1501a67125c4fee99e7575766075d3d with the secret key \"test\" (without quotes).In general, if you&apos;re sending the message to someone who doesn&apos;t have the app installed or doesn&apos;t even have an iPhone, iPad, Android or Windows Phone 7 mobile device, you can always direct them to http://www.secretmessageapp.com/decrypt where they can manually paste in the encrypted message and enter the secret key to decode the message. Please send us your suggestions, questions and bug reports. We would love to make this your ideal secure messaging app! Please feel free to email us at [email\u00a0protected]\n"},

Requires SuperSUIf you are using a pattern lock, enter the current password as a sequence of dot numbers. Dots are numbered left-to-right, top-to-bottom, starting with 1: 1    2    34    5    67    8    9This tool REQUIRES root access to work. If you are not using disk encryption this tool will not be useful to you. In fact, it will not even start on your device. *** WARNING ***If you forget the new password after you change it, you will not be able to boot  the device. You will have to perform a factory reset, DELETING all your data. Make sure you take a full backup before using this tool, and REMEMBER THE PASSWORD. You have been warned, use at your own risk! Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) introduced disk encryption and it has been available on all subsequent versions. It encrypts the data partition with a key protected by a user-selected password and requires entering the password in order to boot the device. However, Android uses the device unlock password or PIN as the device encryption password, and doesn't allow you to change them separately. This effectively forces you  to use a simple password, since you have to enter it each time you unlock your device, usually dozens of times a day. This tool allows you to change the encryption password to a more secure one, without affecting the screen unlock password/PIN. To change the device encryption password simply:  1. Enter the current password (initially the same as the unlock password/PIN) 2. Enter and confirm the new password 3. Hit 'Change password'The changes take effect immediately, but you will only be required to enter the new password the next time you boot your device. Make sure you choose a good password, not based on a dictionary word, since automated tools can brute force a simple password in minutes. Above all, make sure you REMEMBER the new password. If you change the device unlock password/PIN, the encryption password will be automatically changed as well. You need to use this tool again to change it back, if required.

Works with all applications! Easy to use software! Now You can freely visit ALL SITES in any part of the world. Securely encrypt your internet connection and protect your online identity!The main advantages of this technology:- VPN (IPSEC VPN and OpenVPN)- Cloud VPN (Personal server, UDP protocol)- VPN+TOR - You can select VPN location now.- Access to any restricted website.- Full tracking and interception protection.- Full local network attack protection.- Presence of the Firewall, that prevents the scanning of your IP address by Internet intruders.- Open Internet access despite all the local or state restrictions.- Wi-Fi network scan and data acquisition protection.- Full access to all VOIP carriers including Skype.- Completely anonymous Internet access.What is a VPN?A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a clever piece of technology that gives you the choice from being an ordinary Internet user \u2013 to being an Internet VIP. It\u2019s like having a golden ticket for the Internet - it will let you bypass censorship, unblock content and protects your privacy and security whilst you\u2019re online.Why do you need a VPN? Anytime you use a public internet service you are putting your security and privacy at risk. Personal data can easily be misused and stolen in cafes, hotels, airports and other free Wi-Fi hotspots. Globus Free Pro VPN offers you government-level protection and peace of mind for your personal data whenever you surf the internet \u2013 wherever you are.Globus VPN/TOR Free Pro  has the added benefit of allowing you to unblock favourite websites, services and content by switching country. With Globus VPN/TOR you can ensure that you\u2019ll enjoy all your favourite internet services and sites, no matter where you are.Globus VPN + TOR\u2026This is a perfect security solution when users can route Tor through VPN services which will prevent your ISP from seeing that you're using Tor. On one hand, VPNs are more popular than Tor, so you won't stand out as much but on the other hand, in some countries replacing an encrypted Tor connection with an encrypted VPN connection, would be suspicious as well but not with Globus VPN where one can select a specific server in a specific country of your choice. Once the VPN client has connected, the VPN tunnel will be the machine's default Internet connection, and TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) (or Tor client) will route through it.Another advantage here is that this prevents Tor from seeing who you are behind the Globus VPN. So if somebody somehow does manage to break Tor and learn the IP address your traffic is coming from, but your VPN was actually following through on their premises (they won't watch, they won't remember, and they will somehow magically make it so nobody else is watching either), then you'll be better off. But this will not happen. VPN BROWSER FOR PC IN OUR SITE: Anonymously encrypt all traffic! Works with all applications! Easy to use software!

Are you still going to risk sending your messages without encrypting them?\n"},

Your email administrator will need to provide you with the details for one of the following methods in order to enroll with Symantec Encryption Management Server.1) Auto Setup: In order to use Auto Setup, your email administrator must provide you with a configuration file via email. This file will allow you to complete the enrollment process without typing in most of the details.2) Manual Setup: This process requires entering the hostname of the Symantec Encryption Management Server, along with your username and password.

It uses the structure of the existing medium to convey the data in small parts. This makes conveyance through a covert channel virtually undetectable by administrators or users. Covert channels have been used to steal data from highly secure systems.Encrypted Covert channel can pass the undetected payload through most firewalls and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) hiding its data in a packet header or payload. It camouflages its data as a part of an ordinary packet header or a packet body so that packets pass most firewalls and IDSs. However, covert channel also can be detected by an intelligent IDS or highly skilled network administrators even though it can hide the data in Sequence number or ACK (Acknowledge) of TCP/IP header reserved field or use a tool. The encrypted covert channel can prevent extracting the encrypted payload in any case. This technique can be applied to TCP and UDP packets both. This project adopts the UDP covert channel to implement.Covert channel is created by using some of the space available either within the padding or within other parts of the transport of network packets. Covert channels use any means where data can be added to a data stream without affecting the main body of data being transmitted. This allows the covert receiver to abstract data from a system without creating any type of data trail. A single packet might only contain one or two bytes of the covert data stream, making a detection very difficult. Creating a covert channel takes some ingenious programming, and access to the file system at the source end of the communication is essential. This means that a covert channel can only be instigated through viral infection or through a programming effort that has administrative or other authorized access to the system.\n"},

Worried about unprotected Wi-Fi hotspots? Want to be anonymous and protected from surveillance and hackers? Touch VPN \u2013 is the best solution for you!Public Wi-Fi is not safe. Anything you send or receive on your mobile devices on public WiFi can be intercepted, which makes your personal information such as your passwords, pictures, app data and other private information vulnerable to hackers. Touch VPN automatically turns public WiFi into safe and secure private WiFi. Your mobile security, privacy and personal information will be protected from hackers, identity theft, and other malicious activities when we detect a public WiFi network. Touch VPN is powered by one of the most trusted privacy, security and access provider - Hotspot Shield.Highlights of Touch VPN:\u2713 Free:  100% free. No credit card information needed. No trials offered.\u2713 Unlimited:  Truly unlimited. No session, speed or bandwidth limitations.  \u2713 Simple:  Unblock the world with just one touch of the \u201cConnect\u201d button. \u2713 Secured:   Our strong SSL encryption will make you fully anonymous and secured.\u2713 Support:  If you have any feedback or suggestions, please send an email to: [email\u00a0protected]!-------------------------------------------\u25a0 What is a VPNVPN stands for Virtual Private Network. When connecting to a VPN server through Touch VPN for example - it sets up a secured and encrypted connection to the server in another country. Because of the encryption process the data cannot be filtered or blocked. If you live in Sweden for example, when connect to a VPN server in US, your traffic would look like coming from the United States, instead of Sweden. \u25a0 Why using a VPNWith a VPN, you are not only able to unblock geo-restricted or censored services, such as Facebook, Pandora and Youtube; your online privacy and security will be greatly bolstered as you\u2019ll be surfing the web completely anonymously.\u25a0 VPN vs. ProxyVPN and Proxy can both conceal user identity through re-routing your internet traffic and change your IP. A Proxy server is however, completely browser based, whether you are using Chrome, Safari, or Firefox; and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic, and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online freedom, privacy and security.\u25a0 Why Touch VPNTouch VPN is 100% free, unlimited, secured and super easy to use. You can connect to any of the servers below (Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark, France, United States, Netherlands, and Canada) to enjoy unlimited online privacy and freedom. With Touch VPN you can \u21e8 Access any website in any country.  Bypass geo-restrictions to unblock any website wherever you are! Get access to sites that are blocked or censored by government, school or workplace. Evade firewalls to unblock Facebook, watch YouTube, and circumvent VOIP limitations. \u21e8 Protect Your Data from Hackers.  When you\u2019re connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised. Touch VPN encrypts your data and provides you with banking-level security for the best protection.\u21e8 Touch VPN is a one-click VPN Proxy Service.  Touch VPN contains only one button. The button connects you to one of many anonymous servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your devices battery. And, we are a completely unlimited and free VPN!\u21e8 Surf the Web Anonymously. Avoid being snooped by your ISP and prevent websites from ad tracking and targeting. Touch VPN changes your IP address, so your online identity is anonymous and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.0x33FF1B42\n"},

Why?A1: In order to compress your photos as much as possible, without any loss of photo quality, in the app Settings, choose Zipx (Best Method). This compression method examines each file and selects the compression option most likely to supply the best compression results.Q2: I used WinZip to protect a folder of files with a password, but the list of files can still be viewed. Why?A2: Even though the files or folder is encrypted, the file names can still be viewed (but not the file content). For this reason, we recommend that you avoid using confidential information in file or folder names.

Even though we focus on the best cryptographic experience in the Android email world, we try to provide a full functioning mail client with corresponding safety features in general.Since some people do not understand difficult sentences: THIS IS DEMO WHICH DISPLAYS ONLY THE NEWEST 10 MAILS!The unlimited edition of this app will be available via the Google Play Store in form of a purchasable key. The free version of R2Mail2 is also a replacement for our established and also free app X509Tools - so the ability to decrypt or verify content (in form of p7m-files) is even available without creating a mail account.

We cannot react on that!If you get errors please use \"Menu -> Report Error\" on the start-screen to send us the log-file information in your preferred way!Informations about Private Key and Validity Handling:The application comes without a personal key pair (the users private and public key) - so it is fully functioning in the sense of sending and receiving emails as any other mail client and provides the correct usage of validation if the mail you receive is signed by the sender.For signing or encrypting a message it is necessary to use a private key you own. Turn to a Trust Center of your choice as a source of supply. You can find a list of trust centers, which are trusted within the Android world, in the Certificate Store (CA section) of R2Mail2. Please be aware that this app can only support Soft-Token in form of P12-files and will not work with smartcard-based certificates.The private key you use for signing and decryption is bound to the validity of the certificate. This means, that after the certificate is revoked or no longer valid (because the date stated in the field \u201cValid To\u201d of your certificate is in the past) signatures will not be possible. Nonetheless, we implemented the function to decrypt messages with private keys even with no longer valid certificates. So your messages will always be available to you, even with older keys.For more information visit http://r2mail2.com\n"},

Notes are indexed for fast searching.* Password protection option for notes.* Share notes with SMS, email, Twitter, and any other app that accepts plain text.* Quickly add notes.  If you have a slide out keyboard, just slide it out and start typing.* Accepts plain text from other apps that share.* Password locked notes are encrypted beyond the first 20 characters.  This allows you to be able to identify and search for the note, while at the same time have the rest of it encrypted with the AES encryption standard.  This is the same encryption standard used by the US government and banks.* Star notes with star filtering.* Color-code notes and filter your list by color.* Organize notes by category.* Deleted notes are moved to the trash so you have a chance to restore them.Added Features:* SD Card Backup and Restore.  Lets you make a backup of all your notes and stores them encrypted on your SD card.* Continue button after creating your voice note, so you can add additional speech text if needed.* Time to Breathe option - lets you choose how long to wait before stopping speech input.* Full Screen and popup screen text editors.* Quotation marks.

Great when you want to quickly make note of something you'll need at the grocery store.* Notebook organized with color tabs.  You can make a color note tab by long-pressing a note and selecting \"Change Tab Color\".* Simple note-taking.  Many people prefer a notepad app that doesn't require you to make an account and upload all of your notes to a server.  There is no account necessary with ListNote.  All of your notes are stored on your own device.* Dictation software.  You can transcribe your thoughts quickly and easily.  You can then edit the result like you would with any note-taking app.  When you're editing the notes in the text view, you can insert speech anywhere in the text, and even undo the last speech input if it didn't turn out right.* Secure notes.  You can create safe notes that are private.  These private notes are locked with password protection.

License can be bought through an in-app purchase (1.99 EUR / 2.99 USD + tax).Not using any pattern-, PIN- or password lock is a huge security problem, but reentering your PIN code a hundred times a day to unlock your lockscreen can also be annoying.Delayed Lock is a solution to this problem: After unlocking your device, it will turn the secure lock screen off for a user defined amount of time or while you're connected to a certain WiFi network or Bluetooth device - just as the \"personal unlocking\" feature from the latest Android versions! You can turn your phone off and on as often as you want without entering your password/PIN/pattern again.

It can encrypt/ decrypt messages using  AES. This app DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY PERMISSIONS  and is COMPLETELY FREE OF ADVERTISEMENTS. You can be sure that the app does what it promises . The crack resistitvity of an AES  depends on the password length and complexity. The app warns if the user does not selects a password with min 6 characters having atleast one uppercase letter, one lower case, one special character and one digit.Text Encryptor is a Text Encryption application  that allows you to protect your privacy while communicating with friends. It allows you to encrypt/decrypt text messages using Advance Encryption Standard(AES) with a 256 bit (key length).The system computes the 256 bit key from the password string using SHA-256. The system uses Cipher  Block Chaining method (CBC) to encrypt the message in blocks of 128 bits. Block cipher modes for symmetric-key encryption algorithms require plain text input that is a multiple of the block size (ie 128 bits for AES), so messages may have to be padded to bring them to this length. The padding being used is PKCS5Padding. In CBC Explicit Initialization Vectors technique is being used wherein we  prepend a single random block to the plaintext. Encryption is done as normal, except the IV does not need to be communicated to the decryption routine. Whatever IV decryption uses, only the random block is \"corrupted\". This block is discarded and the rest of the decryption is the original plaintext.Electronic Codebook(ECB) block cipher method option has also been given. In ECB the message is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted separately.The disadvantage of this method is that identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks; thus, it must not be used with a non-random  and repetitive data. The ECB mode is deterministic. ECB option is only for academic purpose.Test Mode. AES test values (taken from FIPS-197) are:Key: 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f Plaintext: 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeffCiphertext: 8ea2b7ca516745bfeafc49904b496089Encrypting the plaintext with the key should give the ciphertext, decrypting the ciphertext with the key should give the plaintext. You can test the encryption online by using the test values at http://extranet.cryptomathic.com/aescalc/indexTo test select the mode as ECB on the website and use the above test values. To test for anyother value of Key and data , ensure that the data is exactly 16 Hex (16x8=128 bits) characters long. The key should be 32 Hex characters (32x8=256 bits) long. The mode selected in the android application should be \"Testing with No Padding\". You would observe that the result matches exactly.

Use surespot and everything you send can only be read by the person you sent it to. Period.  Everything sent using surespot is end-to-end encrypted with symmetric-key encryption (256 bit AES-GCM) using keys created with 521 bit ECDH shared secret derivation, but you wont notice because security in surespot is built-in, not a layer over something else. Be confident sending private information and pictures, you have control over your messages, when you delete a sent message it will be removed from the receiver's phone and images are not shareable unless you make them so.  Multiple identities allow you to be who you want with just who you want, and if anyone gets annoying you can block them.  Surespot does not require or store your phone number or email address and we don't mine your data, no advertisements here! Encrypted Voice Messaging.  If your eyes or hands are busy, your keyboard too cumbersome, or you just want to say it instead of type it- voice messages are sent with the same exceptional end to end encryption as the rest of your surespot messages. Simply hold down the microphone button to record your voice message and release to send.Surespot uses your mobile data plan and Wi-Fi so you don\u2019t get texting charges, especially important for those friends in other countries.

App features:  * 128-bit AES encryption using:   - SecureRandom() with &apos;SHA1PRNG&apos; salt   - SecretKeyFactory() with &apos;PBEWithSHAAnd128BitAES-CBC-BC&apos;   - Cipher() with &apos;AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding&apos;  * User-supplied cipher key(s) up to 12 characters long     * No-limit recursive encryption     * Any character set (language) can be encrypted*  * No app restrictions to data manipulation size  * SQLite database for archiving (with search and sort)  * &apos;Share&apos; and Clipboard-paste for forwarding  * Scrollable real-time &apos;on screen&apos; Event Log    * Built-in Help file  * Note: This free version permits only 5 &apos;folders&apos; in the database By using other Android apps, your encrypted data can be posted on the Web or transmitted to other Android devices around the globe. The destination receivers would use their own CryptxHDx app (see note below) and your previously-disclosed encryption key(s) to decipher the forwarded message.If you don&apos;t distribute your cipher texts, then you can save them in a SQLite database on your own Android tablet. The information is stored in &apos;folders&apos; where it can later be individually retrieved and decrypted to reveal your old confidential notes. (A maximum of 5 &apos;folders&apos; are permitted with this free app.)NOTES: If you discover you need more than 5 &apos;folders&apos;, download the app: CryptxHD. The tablet-targeted CryptxHD and CryptxHDx apps, and the smartphone-targeted Cryptxphile and Crypt2phile apps may all be used to decrypt any AES+ data file. Be aware that Triple-DES strings can not be decrypted by the AES algorithm, and vice versa.   Caveat: Mix together enough mathematicians, cryptographers, CPU&apos;s, and research time in a computer lab and you&apos;ll discover any encrypted text on planet Earth can be deciphered. Therefore, don&apos;t expect to find an \"uncrackability\" guarantee with this app! But by combining an off-the-shelf encryption algorithm with multiple private keys and unlimited recursion, hackers will be repulsed from even attempting to brute-force-attack your ciphered texts.* Note1: the Unicode characters x2500-x256C are reserved for data encoding!Note2: This app uses the \"menu\" button...which is likely missing on the newer models of tablets and smartphones! Check which your device manufacturer (via a Google search) to find out how this button is now simulated.\n"},

Why?A1: In order to compress your photos as much as possible, without any loss of photo quality, in the app Settings, choose Zipx (Best Method). This compression method examines each file and selects the compression option most likely to supply the best compression results.Q2: I used WinZip to protect a folder of files with a password, but the list of files can still be viewed. Why?A2: Even though the files or folder is encrypted, the file names can still be viewed (but not the file content). For this reason, we recommend that you avoid using confidential information in file or folder names. For example, avoid using account numbers or ID numbers (such as a social insurance number) in file or folder names.Q3: Why does WinZip Android need permission to access  \"Device ID & call information\" permission? A3: This general access permission is used to better understand the device info when feedback is sent through email and for the WinZip app coordination and tracking with Google.\n"},

Even the choice of Favorite Category is encrypted.\u2022 Encrypts data using AES and Blowfish algorithms with key sizes of 256, 192 and 128 bits. And also supports Triple DES with key sizes of 168 and 112 bits.\u2022 When the data file is decrypted, up to all combinations of algorithm, key size and cipher mode of operation (CBC, CFB, OFB and ECB) are tried with the Master password to unlock the data file. This was inspired by TrueCrypt and makes brute force attacks longer. The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher, key size or cipher mode of operation.\u2022 Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\u2022 The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\u2022 Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.\u2022 Unlike other similar Android apps aWallet has no internet access permission (forever). The only permissions this app has is to access to the USB device to backup/restore the data file in case you lose your phone. USB device access is also needed to export to CSV file format. Permission is also granted to the Google Play billing service to allow for the optional purchase of the aWallet Pro features.For more info see http://www.awallet.org/If you like this App, rate it in the Google Play.

You can then edit the result like you would with any note-taking app.  When you're editing the notes in the text view, you can insert speech anywhere in the text, and even undo the last speech input if it didn't turn out right.* Secure notes.  You can create safe notes that are private.  These private notes are locked with password protection.  When you lock a note it's an easy way to encrypt text from prying eyes.Requirements:* Google voice search is required for speech to text functionality to work.

A patch will be available in 4Q, 2017.Beware that most \"protection apps\" do NOT encrypt your files, they merely change the directories. These applications are easy to defeat and DO NOT provide significant security.  A simple file scan of your phone or our SD card will clearly show your data.You can save Timelock protected files to your SD card, but you should NEVER place unprotected sensative files on the SD card.  Even if you erase them later, you canot guarantee that they were completely erased.  Thus, initially place your files on internal RAM, then save them to Timelock, and then delete the files from the device ram.  Now your files are protected and there is no left over footprint.A high-security vault for photos and videos hidden in a clock=============================================With the new TimeLock\u2122 app, it is not only a timeless clock with an alarm function, but also a high security vault for your personal photos and videos.

With the latest security technologies TimeLock\u2122 keeps all of your pictures and videos militarily secure, because the entire contents of the vault is encrypted with the strong 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. The AES-256-bit encryption method is one of the safest in the world and is used, for example, for encrypting top secret documents in the military. Perfect harmony between visibility and invisibility=====================================TimeLock\u2122 not only impresses with its plain timeless design or the useful alarm clock, with which you can wake up in style, but it intelligently combines function and style. Naturally TimeLock\u2122 can be used or placed as a beautiful clock on a writing or bedside table.

This app uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to encrypt text, so far the only working way of breaking AES without knowing the secret key is by brute force which can take up to a few billion years for a good password.If you want to read an encrypted text message you should first know the secret key and the key length(128, 192 or 256), without knowing them you can't decrypt the ciphertext and read it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------USAGE:The usage of this app is pretty straightforward, however two things are worth mentioning:1. CHANGING THE KEY LENGTH is done by pressing the \"AES-###\" button at the top of the app, where ### is the bit length of the secret key, it can be set to 128, 192 or 256. Different key sizes encrypt text differently even with the same key.2. PASTING TEXT\u00b3 can be done simply by long pressing the text field.*You can encrypt text with this app multiple times using different secret key and key size.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DISCLAIMER:1. The developer of this app distances himself from the contents of the encrypted messages made by its users. Using any kind encryption for criminal activity is illegal. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) also known as Rijndael developed by the Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen is the most widely used symmetric-key encryption algorithm today and is available for free use in many apps.2. In case of a published practical cryptographic \"break\" faster than a brute force against AES, the developer of this app must change the encryption algorythm within a week, however the developer will not be responsible for any previous encrypted messages that can be broken.3. The developer of this app is not responsible if a ciphertext is somehow decrypted using the secret key (or the same bitstream) by an unwanted third party, the secret key can be uncovered in multiple ways for example using a malicious software (keylogger) or being leaked by one of the original users. So far the fastest method of breaking an AES ciphertext, having only the ciphertext, is a brute force attack, so using strong passwords is highly recommended.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOTE_1: The text can be written in any language and in any alphabet that is widely used today, all Unicode/UTF-8 characters can be used.NOTE_2: The key also accepts all Unicode/UTF-8 characters, the strength of the secret key is determined by its length and the variety of different characters that are being used.NOTE_3: Pasting the ciphertext into the text field is the recommended way of inputting a ciphertext. Simply copy the text message from the SMS or any other app.NOTE_4: Encrypt text with this app and enjoy safe communication with you friends and colleagues.\n"},

Devices by some manufacturers seem to lack support for this - strongSwan VPN Client won't work on these devices! * Uses the IKEv2 key exchange protocol (IKEv1 is not supported) * Uses IPsec for data traffic (L2TP is not supported) * Full support for changed connectivity and mobility through MOBIKE (or reauthentication) * Supports username/password EAP authentication (namely EAP-MSCHAPv2, EAP-MD5 and EAP-GTC) as well as RSA/ECDSA private key/certificate authentication to authenticate users, EAP-TLS is also supported * Combined RSA/ECDSA and EAP authentication is supported by using two authentication rounds as defined in RFC 4739 * VPN gateway certificates are verified against the CA certificates pre-installed or installed by the user on the system. The CA or server certificates used to authenticate the gateway can also be imported directly into the app. * IKEv2 fragmentation is supported if the VPN gateway supports it (strongSwan does so since 5.2.1) * Split-tunneling allows sending only certain traffic through the VPN and/or excluding specific traffic from it * Per-app VPN allows limiting the VPN connection to specific apps, or exclude them from using it * The IPsec implementation currently supports the AES-CBC, AES-GCM, ChaCha20/Poly1305 and SHA1/SHA2 algorithms * Passwords are currently stored as cleartext in the database (only if stored with a profile) * VPN profiles may be imported from files (this is the only reason why the app requests android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)Details and a changelog can be found on our wiki: https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/AndroidVPNClient# EXAMPLE GATEWAY CONFIGURATION #This client can be used with the following gateway configuration that is also compatible with the Windows 7+ Agile VPN client:https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Win7EapMultipleConfigBut please note that the host name configured with a VPN profile in the app *must be* contained in the gateway certificate as subjectAltName.# FEEDBACK #Please post bug reports and feature requests on our wiki: https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/issuesIf you do so, please include information about your device (manufacturer, model, OS version etc.).The log file written by the key exchange daemon can be sent directly from within the application.\n"},

Many people still store their sensitive information under contacts, which can easily be seen if your phone falls into the wrong hands...ouch! When you use Pocket, your data is encrypted using the industry standard AES-256. Only you will be able to access your data via a master password. Even if you lose your phone your data will still be safe. For extra security, Pocket doesn't store your master password locally on the device, but rather as a SHA-512 hash. In addition, Pocket self-locks after a timeout period and clears the clipboard to ensure your data is protected.ONLINE DROPBOX BACKUPPocket provides an option to automatically backup your wallet to your Dropbox account.

Confidential files are accessible directly after the login. With one click on the file, the file is decrypted to its original location and can be shown by the installed viewer or editor apps. When you are finished working with the decrypted copy, the file is re-encrypted with one click and the decrypted file is wiped from the SD card. This wipe process will overwrite the data with random bytes before the file is deleted. So even if the device is lost or stolen, it is not possible to access your confidential data.Encrypting new files is very simple: they can be chosen either with the built-in file manager or by simply using \"send/share\" from another app.Features:* Access based on master pin or master text password.* Encrypts all kind of files.* Possibility to encrypt all files of a folder.* Provides a special handling for images, e.g. removal/creation of gallery thumbnail images.* Base functionality of a file manager (view on click, send/share menu), but with automatic decryption before the action.* Offers AES and Twofish encryption with 128 and 256 bit keys.* Displays icons to indicate whether a file is currently decrypted or was changed.* User setting for automatic re-encryption on exit.* Secure overwrite of the orginal file after the encryption.* An additional anti file recovery tool is included.* Two layout modes: flat list view or hierarchical folder view.* Filters can be defined to filter SD card files by file extensions or to excluded folders.* The master password can be changed for an existing database.* Provides a comfortable backup mechanism for using cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, ...) to save the encrypted files* The app can be configured to delete all managed files after 7 unsuccessful attempts.* Has an \"Exit\" menu on all screens, that finishes the task completely.* App is locked (master password must be re-entered), when there is no user input for configurable period.* Includes english help pages.Languages:* English* German* French* Russian* SpanishLimitations:* The \"lite\" version is limited to 5 encrypted files!* The full version has no limitations.Keywords: file encryption, data encryption, file manager, crypto, SD card, encryption algorithm, AES, Twofish, backup\n"},

Morelock is a utility designed to encrypt compressed zip file systems using the AES encryption system. Morelock_Lite uses 128 bit AES encryption to lock files and directories inside a zip output file. Morelock .MRK files are locked zip files that contain the data selected. Morelock does not delete the selected files and directories.AES (acronym of Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm. The algorithm was developed by two Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. AES was designed to be efficient in both hardware and software. Morelock_Lite will decode files key lengths of 128 and 256 bits.  However, Morelock_Lite will only lock files using 128 bit AES keys.Morelock is intended to perform in 2 ways -LOCAL OPERATIONLocks and unlocks files on a specific device. The files are controlled locally on the device and are not intended to be shared.KEY IN FILE OPERATIONLocks and unlock files independent of the device. The AES keys are embedded inside the .MRK output file. The .MRK file can be shared between devices, sent as email attachment, placed on websites or in the cloud. Any user who has the password and Morelock application can access the .MRK file contents.\n"},

Securely hide your photos, so that no one except you can access them. SafeCamera has it's own camera module that ensures 100% secure storage of the photos.Key features:Take photos that will be instantly on the fly encrypted and thus never be visible to any application or person until you open it with SafeCamera providing your master password.Gallery to browse your encrypted photosCamera with flash and timer for taking self shotsImport existing photos/files to SafeCamera encrypting also filenames and delete original filesShare encrypted photos ether encrypted with same password, other password or decryptedImport encrypted files from other SafeCamera instanceEncryption with state of the art algorithms and implementation schemes that are proven to be 100% secure by governmental and military organizations.We have thought of everything! Did you know that once any info is written into the memory and then deleted or even overwritten with another file, it is still possible to restore it? SafeCamera never writes your unencrypted photos into your phone\u2019s SD card. The photo is encrypted on the fly right after it is taken and only then is written to your SD card.Do you have files that you would like to keep safe? Just import them into Safe Camera\u2019s domain and they will be safe. Although SafeCamera is mainly for handling photos, you can also import and keep safely any other file types.Want to share an encrypted photo with someone?

It can encrypt/ decrypt files using  AES. This app ONLY REQUIRES PERMISSION to WRITE SD CARD and NOTHING MORE, so you can be sure ,that your DATA IS SAFE.   It  is COMPLETELY FREE OF ADVERTISEMENTS. You can be sure that the app does what it promises . The crack resistitvity of an AES  depends on the password length and complexity. The app warns if the user does not selects a password with min 6 characters having atleast one uppercase letter, one lower case, one special character and one digit.File Encryptor is a file Encryption application  that allows you to protect your image,doc,xls etc data files. It allows you to encrypt/decrypt files using Advance Encryption Standard(AES) with a 256 bit (key length).The system computes the 256 bit key from the password string using SHA-256. The system uses Cipher  Block Chaining method (CBC) to encrypt the data in blocks of 128 bits. Block cipher modes for symmetric-key encryption algorithms require plain text input that is a multiple of the block size (ie 128 bits for AES), so messages may have to be padded to bring them to this length. The padding being used is PKCS5Padding. In CBC Explicit Initialization Vectors technique is being used wherein we  prepend a single random block to the plaintext. Encryption is done as normal, except the IV does not need to be communicated to the decryption routine. Whatever IV decryption uses, only the random block is \"corrupted\". This block is discarded and the rest of the decryption is the original plaintext.Electronic Codebook(ECB) block cipher method option has also been given to be compatible with legacy version of the app. In ECB the message is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted separately.The disadvantage of this method is that identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks; thus, it must not be used with a non-random  and repetitive data. The ECB mode is deterministic. ECB option is only for academic purpose and backward compatibility.You can use it to encrypt files before putting them on online locations (cloud storage, Google Drive, Skydrive, Box, Dropbox, Gmail, etc.) or to store encrypted sensitive files on your Android phone so that they are unreadable to those who don't know your password.Features\u2022 AES encryption format.\u2022 File encryption and decryption.\u2022 Secure erase of original files after encryption or decryption ( will be build in future versions).\u2022 Internal file browser for selecting.\u2022 Send/share functionality for Google Drive, SkyDrive, Box, Dropbox, Gmail, Bluetooth etc.\u2022 Encrypt your files before putting them in the cloud storage (Google Drive, SkyDrive, Box, Dropbox etc.)\u2022 Password can be up to 40 characters (minimum 6 and recommended at least 12 characters or more)\u2022 Encrypted files have .aes_ extension.\u2022 Files after encryption/decryption go to the same folder.Incase of any issues, feel free to write to me at[email\u00a0protected]PSSome good links to learn cryptography process being used in the app are as underAEShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL1ApwEXrz0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayiOhApI6SMBlock Ciphers, Why not use ECB?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0pREiDO7_ghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipherUTF-8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLBtrd9Ar28\n"},

Hence adversary can simply access the storage file directly and read the content. Using encryption is proper secure way to keep sensitive information safe.Q: If someone connects phone to computer and copies/read the data file storing all the notes, can't they read everything?A: They can't. No one can, regardless how they access the data file (unless they have your secret password). The application uses a technique called encryption. Encryption uses your password to convert notes to unreadable form which makes no sense to anyone even computer. This can be converted back to readable text only using exact same password.Q: I forgot my password. How do I recover my notes?A: You can't. Your password is not stored anywhere but in your brain. If you lose your password, you will lose all your notes. Storing password locally or on server is a security hole which should be avoided.Q: I can't take screenshots from app or I see blank screenshot in application switcher. What's wrong?A: You probably have enabled \"Secure Window\" feature in SealNote settings. Disable it to be able to take screenshots or show window content in application switcher.ContactHomepage: www.twistedplane.comEmail   : [email\u00a0protected]File bug reports at Github https://github.com/vishesh/sealnote/issues or email at above address with [Sealnote][BUG] tags in subject.\n"},

Encryptsy is not just another encryption app; it's an encryption service for those who want the highest protection possible without all the complexity.Encryptsy was inspired by UC Davis Ph.D researcher Phillip Rogaway, based on his February 2011 research paper Evaluation of Some Blockcipher Modes of Operation, where he provides an in-depth analysis of various modes of AES, particularly ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, XTS, CCM, and GCM. His findings, as well as those of government-funded institutions throughout the world, conclude that GCM is the highest performing AES mode both in terms of speed and securing highly confidential data. The use of AES-GCM can be found within Intel's Xeon processors, is referred to by Cisco Systems as being \"Next Generation Encryption\", and is the only AES mode present and recommended by the NSA's Suite B Cryptography standard.(http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/modes.pdf)[+] AES-GCM 256-bit encryption with 128-bit IV.[+] File, directory and nested directories encryption and decryption.[+] File chooser for interactively selecting multiple files and/or multiple directories.[+] Each file is encrypted with its own securely generated encryption key.[+] File thumbnail images are removed from the cache after encryption, and re-added after decryption (almost all encryption apps do not do this).[+] Creating an Encryptsy account places an encrypted vault on your device which stores file encryption keys. The vault only stores MD5 hashes of encrypted files and their corresponding encryption keys; no other information is stored and no list is maintained as to what files have been encrypted and the account they were encrypted by as this convenience only presents security concerns; it is the responsibility of the user to keep track of what files they've encrypted and where they're located. Each account creates its own vault.[+] Upon creating an account, your vault's key is encrypted on your device via AES-GCM with a randomly generated companion encryption key that resides with your vault before being sent to Encryptsy's servers for storage, safe from prying eyes. Upon signing in, the encrypted key is retrieved, decrypted with the vault's companion key on your device, then the decrypted key decrypts the vault. You may now encrypt/descrypt files! The vault is updated after each file is encrypted.[+] Set a decoy password whereupon using it to log in will delete your account from Encryptsy's servers in the event that you are forced to relinquish your credentials, thereby making your vault virtually impossible to open (a simple 'error logging in' message is displayed and your device is unaffected by this operation).[+] Your account (and vault) is essentially bound to your device; there will be no feature to migrate your account (and vault) to another device as this presents security concerns.[+] No account password reset or retrieval. This is done to stem incidences of unauthorized access, account theft and account lockout attacks.[+] If you want to migrate to another device, or if you feel that your credentials have been compromised, then you must decrypt your files and re-encrypt them under a new account.[+] Encryptsy's servers only store your AES-GCM encrypted vault decryption key and Bcrypt-hashed username, password, and decoy password in its database; nothing in the database is stored in plain text.[+] Encryptsy's servers do not store cookies or maintain login sessions, nor does the app; signing into your account is just a simple database lookup via Bcrypt hash comparison.[+] encrypt/decrypt as much as you want without any limitations and create as many accounts as you want.Terms of Use: I am in no way responsible for any damages as a result of using Encryptsy. Use Encryptsy at your own risk.\n"},

Usually you could just do this in Android settings, but on some devices this option is hidden, or only works if you have a SIM inserted.Hotspot Control does away with those requirements, assuming that the hotspot functionality itself is actually still present and operational on the device. Rooting is *usually* not required. THIS IS NOT DESIGNED TO BEAT YOUR CARRIER'S TETHERING PROTECTION, OR LET YOU TETHER FOR FREE - For some people it does (it depends on how that protection is implemented) but this is not what the app was made for. It's no use complaining that it doesn't do this for you. This app is designed to circumvent some issues when setting up a *local* hotspot so your devices can communicate with eachother, *not* with the internet (though that also works on several devices).You can configure the access point (hotspot) name and password, encryption used is alway WPA2 AES + TKIP, to keep it simple.On some devices that do not have a cellular data connection capability (like the Nexus 10) the hotspot will not give out IP addresses - the app will auto-detect this situation and fix it, but root is required for that option. Note that without root on these devices, the connected devices can still communicate if you configure their IP addresses manually, but that is something for the advanced user.I personally need this to create a private network (even without a SIM, and thus without an actual *internet* connection) in the field between a number of my devices. Some genius at Samsung decided that my Note II shouldn't create an access point if no SIM is present - I beg to differ! Maybe someone else has use for this as well.For discussion and questions, see the thread on XDA: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2230848\n"},

The PDU Editor has a Index Editor to edit the instance sub-identifier of columnar objects comfortably by providing values for the sub-index object separately.The build-in MIB Compiler with strong and lenient syntax checking can be used to load standard MIBs. MIB files can be download from the Internet or load from the local filesystem (i.e., SD card). The compiler can process plain text files and ZIP files of plain text files. In the latter case, it sorts the ZIP file entries by their IMPORT dependencies to automatically resolve them.The Trap Receiver notifies the user about new TRAP or INFORM messages. Starting with Android 4.1 also using its Notification mechanisms. To receive traps, a WLAN or LAN connection is required, because most Telco provider (for GSM/3G) provides block such messages by their firewalls.The Settings menu provides various configuration options. Here, the SNMP targets and users (communities) are defined as well as how MIB data is formatted when displayed and which MIB modules should be loaded from the local repository at App start-up. To facilitate MIB setup, MIB Explorer can scan the selected target to determine the MIB subset its supports which is then automatically loaded and optionally also configured for App start-up.In a nutshell, the key features are:++ SNMP v1,2c,3 over UDP and TCP with MD5, SHA authentication and DES, 3DES, AES-128/196/256 privacy. ++ User-friendly interface with auto-completion for object names and enumerations. ++ Auto-discover MIB set supported by a device and load it from the internal MIB repository.++ Unlimited SNMP target, SNMPv3 user & SNMPv1/v2c community configuration.++ Unrivaled PDU Editor to create, send, save and load any SNMP PDU type from browse results or traps.++ MIB Compiler with lenient and strict syntax checks for standard MIBs.++ Best SNMP table view for Android on-the-market with advanced row index editor.++ Trap Receiver (UDP, TCP & SNMPv1,2c,3) notifies user about events from devices connected by WLAN.++ SNMP URI support by Browse activity with auto-completion.++ MIB Tree filter by SMI object properties for quick object (OID) lookup.++ Browser activity supports sub-tree walk.++ Optional master password to AES encrypt all SNMPv3 passphrases.++ [Pro Edition only:] Compile vendor MIBs from ZIP or text files from URL or local file (i.e. SD card)*.*The MIB Explorer Pro Editon provides a MIB compiler which can parse, syntax check, and load any SMI v1 or v2 vendor MIB specification.\nMIB Explorer Android (Free) for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

It will probably take seven to ten seconds-- and it will have that awkward cellular delay when you talk.  Now, do the same thing using CLEAR.  Enter a CLEAR user name, hit send and count as you wait for the other user's phone or tablet to ring.  Your CLEAR call will be instantaneous and crystal CLEAR, without the cellular delay.CLEAR allows you to send private messages, photos, videos and make crystal CLEAR Wi-Fi/data calls, then CLEAR any trace of them-- from your device and all recipients\u2019 devices when you want.  When you CLEAR a sent message or complete a CLEAR call, there's no log of your activity.  CLEAR helps you reclaim your personal privacy and security.  To use the CLEAR app, all you need is a smartphone or tablet and another person who is a CLEAR user.  So, tell your friends to download CLEAR and take advantage of the new standard in mobile messaging security!\n"},

It reads and writes .kdbx-files, the database format used by the popular KeePass 2.x Password Safe for Windows and other desktop operating systems.The user interface is based on Keepassdroid (by Brian Pellin), ported from Java to Mono for Android. The backend uses the original KeePass libraries to handle file access to ensure file format compatibility.Main features of the App are* read/write support for .kdbx (KeePass 2.x) files* integrates with nearly every Android browser (see below)* QuickUnlock: Unlock your database once with your full password, re-open it by typing just a few characters (see below)* Access files from the cloud or the web (Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive, FTP, WebDAV). You can use \"Keepass2Android Offline\" if you don't need this feature. * Integrated Soft-Keyboard: Switch to this keyboard for entering user credentials. This shields you from clipboard based password sniffers (see below)* support for editing entries including additional string fields, file attachments, tags etc.* search dialog with all search options from KeePass 2.x.

This will* bring up a screen to load/unlock a database if no database is loaded and unlocked* go to the Search Results screen displaying all entries for the currently visited URL  - or -* directly offer the Copy Username/Password notifications if exactly one entry matches the currently visited URL == QuickUnlock ==You should protect your password database with a strong (i.e. random and LONG) password including upper and lower case as well as numbers and special characters. Typing such a password on a mobile phone every time you unlock your database is time-consuming and error-prone. The KP2A solution is QuickUnlock:* Use a strong password for your database* Load your database and type the strong password once. Enable QuickUnlock.* The application is locked after the time specified in the settings* If you want to re-open your database, you can type just a few characters (by default, the last 3 characters of your password) to unlock quickly and easily!* If the wrong QuickUnlock key is entered, the database is locked and the full password is required to re-open. Is this safe? First: it allows you to use a really strong password, this increases safety in case someone gets your database file. Second: If you loose your phone and someone tries to open the password database, the attacker has exactly one chance to make use of QuickUnlock. When using 3 characters and assuming 70 characters in the set of possible characters, the attacker has a 0.0003% chance of opening the file. If this sounds still too much for you, choose 4 or more characters in the settings.QuickUnlock requires an icon in the notification area. This is because Android would kill Keepass2Android too often without this icon. It does not require battery power. == Keepass2Android Keyboard == A German research team has demonstrated that clipboard-based access of credentials as used by most Android password managers is not safe: Every app on your phone can register for changes of the clipboard and thus be notified when you copy your passwords from the password manager to your clipboard. In order to protect against this kind of attack, you should use the Keepass2Android keyboard: When you select an entry, a notification will appear in the notification bar. This notification lets you switch to the KP2A keyboard. ON this keyboard, click the KP2A symbol to \"type\" your credentials. Click the keyboard key to switch back to your favorite keyboard.\nKeepass2Android Password Safe for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

Haanel that was originally published as a correspondence course in 1912. Though originally a 24 week correspondence course, it was published in book form in 1916. It was first published as a book in 1916 by Psychology Publishing, St. Louis and The Master Key Institute, New York.Along with \"The Science of Getting Rich\", by Wallace D. Wattles, the Master Key System is the source of Rhonda Byrne's inspiration for the book and the film \"The Secret\" (2006).Charles F. Haanel was an American author, millionaire, entrepreneur, and businessman who belonged to several Masonic societies, the American Scientific League, The Author\u2019s League of America, The American Society of Psychical Research, the St. Louis Humane Society, and the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce.The Master Key System has gained popularity in recent years, in no small part from its influence on the film The Secret, but also in part from a number of other rumors. The two most prominent are that it was the source of Bill Gates' inspiration and success behind Microsoft, and that the book was banned by the Roman Catholic Church. It states that Gates discovered the book as a student at Harvard. He was so inspired he dropped out and went on to found Microsoft. Several sources refer to this story, however there remains no verified reference that this is anything but a rumor.Similarly, there are accounts that the book dropped out of sight partly as a result of being banned by the Church. This would presumably be the Roman Catholic Church. However, again there is no verifiable reference to this being the case. An ancillary rumor to the banned by the Church rumor, is that Haanel himself wanted to keep the information in the book esoteric, and accessible only to a few.----------------------Looking for ebooks?

This includes short practice tests, instead of reading and rereading which has been shown to be an ineffective method of learning compared to reflective practice.  App features and suggested memory training strategies are listed below.1.   All grades of music theory (7 sharps, 7 flats, major and minor keys) are covered in short practice tests of 15 or more questions from the following  key signature categories:\tA. major sharps;\tB. minor sharps;\tC. major flats;\tD. minor flats;\tE. major sharps  and flats;\tF. minor sharps and flats;\tG. major and minor sharps;\tH. major and minor flats;\tI. major and minor, sharps  and flats - all key signatures (15, 30 or 45 random questions).2.  Use clues in a tutorial mode, for beginners or to refresh your memory,  this is optional on all quizzes and if used is marked in the results graph for your information.3. Each key signature quiz you do is saved and plotted on a line graph. This will help you to monitor your key signature music theory progress over time and improve your results and study patterns.  Date, time of day, and time taken, are recorded for up to 42 attempts in each key signature category (you can clear data separately for each category if needed). 4. A bar graph compares your  results from the four main key signature categories - major sharps, minor sharps, major flats and minor flats. Once you have achieved high scores, with quick recall (time taken) in these four categories try mixed categories such and major and minor sharps, finally building up to quizzes of  30 or 45 questions covering all key signatures.5. The randomness of the quiz questions has been adjusted to maximize learning in several ways. One of these is that you will not be asked the same question again after you have correctly answered it twice, in that quiz attempt.6.  Your daily high, low and average  scores in each key signature category are also calculated and plotted on the daily stats graph.  This can be used to monitor memory retention.  How much can you recall after 1 day, week or month and how long does it take you to recall the information?How fast can you finish the quiz?\n"},

Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double bar line.A key signature designates notes that are to be played higher or lower than the corresponding natural notes and applies through to the end of the piece or up to the next key signature. A sharp symbol on a line or space in the key signature raises the notes on that line or space one semitone above the natural, and a flat lowers such notes one semitone. Further, a symbol in the key signature affects all the notes of one letter: for instance, a sharp on the top line of the treble staff applies to F's not only on that line, but also to F's in the bottom space of the staff, and to any other F's.In principle, any piece can be written with any key signature, using accidentals to correct the pattern of whole and half steps. The purpose of the key signature is to minimize the number of such accidentals required to notate the music. The sequence of sharps or flats in key signatures is generally rigid in modern music notation. For example, if a key signature has only one sharp, it must be an F sharp.This app helps you get familiar with them and memorize them. It provides different ways (chart, flashcards and quizzes) to help you study. At the end, you would be able to identify different music key signatures on different clefs (treble, bass, alto and tenor) as quick as possible. It's suitable for young kids or any people who're preparing for music theory exams, such as RCM's.\n"},

Additionally, many citrus varieties are backyard crop plants, providing important sources of food at a local community level. As a result, citrus is one of the most economically important groups of plants. Numerous insect pests threaten the citrus industry and backyard citrus trees through feeding damage, while other pests vector diseases that are potentially lethal.Citrus Pests Key is aimed primarily at extension agents, inspectors, and other plant professionals with access to a light microscope and hand lens. It is designed to help users determine which type of citrus insect pest they have encountered by featuring an interactive key coupled with illustrated, descriptive fact sheets for each pest. Citrus Pests Key is intended to be used as a screening aid. For definitive species identification, specimens should be sent to an expert for verification.During the initial development of the key, an advisory committee developed a comprehensive list of over 300 pest and beneficial arthropods that needed to be considered for inclusion into the key. Since the key was designed and scoped as a basic screening aid to support survey and detection support, 51 total species from the comprehensive list were selected by the authors based on the following criteria:- commonly found insect pests on cultivated citrus in the U.S. as determined by the Citrus Pest Advisory Committee,- citrus insect pests that have been intercepted at U.S. ports but have not become established,- insect pests that have entered the U.S. but have now been eradicated, and- exotic insect pests of immediate concern to U.S. cultivated citrus.Key authors: Sarahlynne Guerrero, Jennifer Weeks, Amanda Hodges, Kirk Martin, and Norman LepplaThis key is part of a complete Citrus Pests tool: http://idtools.org/id/citrus/pests/Lucid Mobile key developed by USDA APHIS ITP\n"},

Since many diseases, disorders, and insect pests can cause similar symptoms, this key will often lead to more than one possible field diagnosis. Consulting the fact sheets may help to narrow down the diagnosis to a single cause. For definitive confirmation of diseases and insects, the appropriate tissue samples or insect specimens should be sent to an expert for verification.This key is based solely on visual symptoms for two primary reasons. First, visual symptoms are sufficient to diagnose many palm problems, especially physiological disorders such as nutrient deficiencies. Second, visual symptoms are the first step in determining which diagnostic lab to use for further analysis and which tissue should be sampled for analysis. Many times, diagnosis of a palm problem is a multi-step procedure whereby possible causes of the problem are ruled out, one at a time. Never rely on a laboratory diagnosis without also making a good faith attempt at the visual diagnosis. The two diagnoses should agree. Just because a laboratory report suggests deficiencies of one or more nutrient elements or the presence of one or more potential pathogens does not mean that those deficiencies or pathogens are the actual cause of the particular problem. False positives are common, and often misleading. This is one weakness of laboratory diagnostics when used as the sole method of diagnosis. In the case of palm diseases, false negatives are also a common problem, especially when the wrong tissue is sampled or a sample of poor quality is submitted to the laboratory. If the two diagnoses (visual and lab) do not agree, then re-examine the problem to determine which diagnosis is more likely to explain the symptoms being observed (compare to descriptions and photos in the fact sheets), and if you sampled the correct material for the laboratory diagnosis. Alternatively, you may need to start at the beginning as neither diagnosis may be correct.The intended audience for this key is non-experts working in the field within Cooperative Agriculture Pest Survey (CAPS), National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), and other national, regional, and state agricultural agencies/organizations with responsibilities associated with pest and disease survey and detection. However, the key will be useful for anyone who manages palms in a nursery or landscape setting. All features in the key can be used with the naked eye or a hand lens.Mary Andrews contributed the image for the splash page.

It should be noted that this key is not inclusive of all mollusc pests, as new species of interest arise almost daily.The list of species included in this tool was generated based on pest species reported in scholarly publications by Barker 2002, Cowie et al. 2009, and Godan 1983 as well as commonly intercepted species documented in the port of entry interception data from US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine division (USDA-APHIS-PPQ) and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) -Division of Plant Industry.The key is unable to identify a few entities below the family level. This is true especially for the families Veronicellidae and Succineidae. The major reason for this is the lack of diagnostic morphological characters and the variability of members of these groups. In many cases, it is recommended that molecular techniques be used in the identification of members of these families (Holland and Cowie 2007; Gomes et al. 2010). This inadequacy of the key is, however, mitigated by the fact that most if not all members of these problematic groups are pestiferous and as such are regulated at the family level. The same is true for the species complexes (e.g., Arion hortensis group, A. ater group) included in the tool.The Terrestrial Mollusc Key was developed and published by the Center for Plant Health Science and Technology (CPHST) as part of a cooperative agreement with the Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) and is under the direction of Terrence Walters, CPHST Identification Technology Program (ITP) coordinator.The photographs utilized in this key were generously provided by those credited on each. The photographers and organizations that gave permission to use their images are also credited in the acknowledgements of the original tool (http://idtools.org/id/mollusc/). All drawings were produced by the University of Florida, unless otherwise noted.Author: Jodi White-McLean (Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida)Editors and Advisors: John Capinera (Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida) and John Slapcinsky (Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida)Original Illustrations and Photography: Kay Weigel and Lyle Buss (Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida)Lucid Mobile key developed by USDA APHIS ITP\n"},

In the twenty-first century market, dried botanicals consist of whole or sectioned fungi, fruits, seeds, leaves, and almost anything that is botanical, has abundant air spaces (\"physical fixatives\" for the synthetic oils), has structural interest, and/or is inexpensive (e.g. lawn sweepings and waste products of other industries). While chiefly imported, materials are occasionally from North American sources. These botanicals may include potentially toxic species (e.g. strychnine leaves and fruits) as well as potential invasives (e.g., she-oak, an invasive in Florida). The latter can be a problem when buyers throw old potpourri in the garden. Some (e.g. members of the Rutaceae) may carry plant diseases.Because these botanical materials are often not only sectioned but also bleached and/or dyed and then scented with fragrance oils, a botanical key to the whole plant, or even plant parts, is not practical. Thus, in this unique identification key, features such as shape, size, and texture are used. The key relies heavily upon the use of images and is structured so that both the professional botanist, who knows the difference between the Agaricales and Polyporales, and the amateur, who may not be able to distinguish sections of a bracket fungus from pieces of stem pith, can achieve an identification for a specimen. Because of the diversity of plants and plant parts and the accompanying esoteric vocabulary, practical terms (e.g. \"football-shaped\") have been used in the key.

As part of its effort to prevent the introduction of invasive or potentially invasive weeds, the USDA maintains an official list of \"federal noxious weeds\" (FNW) (7 CFR 360.200 and 361.6). Many taxa on this list are currently serious weeds elsewhere in the world, and about two-thirds of the taxa are currently found in the U.S. Most of the FNW taxa are angiosperms, but a few are ferns and one is a green alga. NOTE that the ferns and alga are not included in this app.Fruits and seeds are the plant disseminules most responsible for the spread of weeds to new regions. Federal Noxious Weed Disseminules of the U.S. Keys was developed to enable accurate identification of FNW angiosperm disseminules. The three keys (Grasses=Poaceae; Legumes=Fabaceae; and Other Angiosperm Plant Families) were designed to be used by officials at U.S. ports responsible for identification of plant pests. It may also be a useful resource for seed professionals and anyone else with an interest in, or a need to know about, noxious weed disseminules.Thirty-one families are currently represented on the FNW list as of 2013. Most of the taxa are individual species, but two are species complexes, Rubus fruticosus L. agg. and Salvinia auriculata complex (not included in the app key since an aquatic ferm), and one is an infraspecific taxon (Setaria pumila (Poir.) Roem. & Schult. ssp. pallidefusca (Schumach) B. K. Simon). Note that fact sheets for the FNW species of six genera Aeginetia, Alectra, Cuscuta, Moraea, Orobanche, Striga have been treated together in their own \"genus-level\" fact sheets.The three interactive family keys include only those FNW taxa that produce seed and fruit disseminules (i.e., angiosperms). Eight taxa are not included in the interactive keys either because they lack angiosperm sexual reproduction altogether or they produce seed only rarely. One group lacking fruits and seeds are the ferns, which reproduce via spores as well as by vegetative means. Reproduction via vegetative disseminules is the primary means of dispersal for some non-ferns (three angiosperms and an alga) as well. The eight taxa not in the keys are the terrestial ferns Lygodium flexuosum (L.) Sw. and Lygodium microphyllum (Cav.) R. Br., the aquatic ferns Azolla pinnata R.Br. and the Salvinia auriculata complex, the aquatic angiosperms Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle and Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss, the sterile angiosperm hybrid Opuntia aurantiaca Lindl., and the alga Caulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) Agardh.All photographic images were produced by the authors except where acknowledged in image captions. See FNW tool for proper guidelines for use and citation of images. The majority of original illustrations were drawn by Lesley Randall. The remainder were drawn by Ingrid Hogle and Julia Scher. Drawings by Lynda E. Chandler are from Gunn and Ritchie (1988). Drawings by Regina O. Hughes are from Terrell and Peterson (1993) and Reed (1977).Key authors: Julia Scher and Deena WaltersThis key is part of a complete FNW tool: http://itp.lucidcentral.org/id/fnw/Lucid Mobile key developed by USDA APHIS ITP\n"},

They are commonly cultivated as ornamentals, and many palms have been used as crop plants for centuries, providing important sources of food and a variety of other products. As such, palms are one of the most economically important groups of plants. Relative to most cultivated plants, palms are relatively pest-free. However, a number of arthropod pests attack palms in sufficient force to be a threat to the plant, and some vector diseases that are potentially lethal to palms.The intended audience for these keys is non-experts working in the field within Cooperative Agriculture Pest Survey (CAPS), National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), and other national, regional, and state agricultural agencies/organizations with responsibilities associated with pest and disease survey and detection. Since these keys are intended as a screening aid for less experienced users in the field, most features in the keys can be used with the naked eye or a handlens. Infrequently, a dissecting microscope or stereoscope may be required for very small specimens. For definitive species confirmation, specimens should be sent to an expert for verification.Palm Pests is, first and foremost, a tool to aid the non-entomologist user in identifying which type of pest they may have, i.e. mite or scale? beetle or thrips? Therefore, the scope of the keys is the arthropod pests of palms, including mites and insects. The keys may take the user to class, order, family, genus, or species. The pest groups featured include mites, beetles, termites, moths and butterflies, bugs, and thrips. The keys provide screening and identification support to cultivated palm pests known to occur, as of 2010, in the United States (continental U.S. and Hawaii) and Caribbean Islands. Also included are pests of immediate concern to cultivated palms in the United States and Caribbean essentially those species that will likely move to this region in the very near future.Key authors: Amanda J. Redford, Terrence Walters, Amanda Hodges, and Forrest W.

The ability to identify a palm host is an important aid to pest and disease identification, as many diseases and pests may be host specific. Palm ID Key supports users that may only have a portion of a complete representative sample of a plant. This key allows users to identify many specimens to species, though this is not possible in all cases, as many palms are capable of hybridizing.The intended audience for this key is non-experts working in the field within Cooperative Agriculture Pest Survey (CAPS), National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), and other national, regional, and state agricultural agencies/organizations with responsibilities associated with pest and disease survey and detection. However, the key will be useful for anyone who manages palms in a nursery or landscape setting. All features in the key can be used with the naked eye or a hand lens.Information is provided for 82 commonly cultivated palm species from 48 genera, but given the difficulty of separating palm species and the number of hybrids among them, you might only be able to determine the genus for a particular palm. Only adult palms (not seedlings or pre-reproductive juvenile palms) are included in the key and descriptions. The key is illustrated with hundreds of images of species and their characteristics or features. This key provides identification support for palms that are commonly cultivated, as of 2010, in the United States (continental U.S. and Hawaii) and Caribbean Islands.Mary Andrews contributed the image for the splash page.

Agree, many hotspots are closed  with password because at the dawn of WiFi - it was a kind of a policy to do so, just a habit. Everyone tended to protect his WiFi network, not clearly understanding its essence and principle of operation, therefore protected his WiFi network as much as possible. Those days are gone, now protecting WiFi networks in many cases (especially if it is a public place or private network) - it's more a habit from the past than necessity. Passwords from WiFi networks are distributed \"here\" and \"there\", but this process causes some inconvenience: to find someone to ask, to hear the password properly, input it correctly. To automate the distribution of passwords this program was created. This software product - a small add-on on top of the connecting to WiFi process, something, what you do every time connecting to unknown networks. Instead of the standard interface, use it and share passwords easily.It allows you to:1) Share the password from any WiFi network with other people.2) Use passwords from WiFi networks that are shared by other users of the application.Among the features:1) Getting passwords from server via either WiFi or 3g \\ GPRS channels;2) Locating WiFi networks in certain radius from your current location with phone's GPS sensor, download passwords in program's cache and use them even without Internet connection in place;3) Displaying all networks listing that you have share;4) English, Russian and Arabic interface languages;How does this work:You come to a place where there are several Wi-fi connections. Open the program and it shows you them. Networks list displays all available WiFi networks splitting them into three categories:a) white with a lock: these are the networks on which the password is not yet known for application's users, they are closed and you can't connect to them if you do not know the password. If you do know the password from the network, you enter it through the application and, accordingly, share with everyone else who uses this program.b) yellow with a lock: these are the networks for which you do not know the password, but at the same time it has been shared by someone who was in this place before you. If the password is still relevant, you can connect to the network without any problems, if no, you will be prompted to input password, and thus update it.c) green with a lock: it is just one of the networks, its is the one to which you are connected at the moment;In addition to these three major categories you can also see networks without the lock either white or yellow which means they are not locked and you can connect to them.The program works in two ways:a) when you are connected to the Internet (for example via another Wi-fi network or via GPRS)b) when you are not connected to the Internet, using passwords that were saved in the radius from the specified point on the map.This program is completely free and is designed more as a social initiative, rather than as a commercial application. Help each other to make the Internet more open.Please do not leave bad reviews\\marks just because you did not find the password from some network. Be patient, share networks themselves and one time(I believe very and very soon) by opening the application in a place with Wi-fi networks, where you have never been, you'll be pleasantly surprised.If you find a bug in the program, please, instead of leaving bad reviews\\marks, leave us a comment at: http://wi-fi-key.com/contact us and describe your problem. We promise to solve it as soon as possible.\n"},

This methodology was taught by Charlie Banacos who was an American pianist, composer, author and educator, concentrating on jazz. This useful application will train you to recognise pitches relative to a key center! Relative pitch is more useful than recognising individual intervals because you will be able to identify pitches of any song in relation to the song key centre. In short summary, the methodology works this way:1. Listen to a major key cadence C-F-G-C (I-IV-V-I). It sets the tonal centre.2. After the cadence, single random pitch will be played. It can be from the same octave as the cadence or one octave up / down.3. Guess that random pitch! The key to success is to do this exercise regularly every day, until you internalise all notes.It can well take months if not a year. If you have issue to recognise just one or two notes, use the baby mode where you choose only problematic notes to train.\n"},

On older versions of Android: (e) long-press textbox, select \"Input method\"; (f) select \"Morse Straight Key\".This is a keyboard for your Android device that imitates a straight key, a device commonly used to send Morse Code. The straight key works like a simple switch, allowing the operator to close a circuit, and the length of time that the circuit is closed dictates the duration of the signal: short, producing a dot, or long, producing a dash.There is only a single \"SIGNAL\" button which produces a dit when tapped quickly, or a dah when long-pressed, so your timing has to be just right!Features two modes:- Practice: tap the SIGNAL button for a dit, long-press for dah. After composing a character, tap the GAP button to \"transmit\" the character (short gap), or long-press to transmit the character and a space (medium gap).- Realistic: same as practice mode, but now the system decides what is a dit and what is a dah based on how long you hold down the SIGNAL button. Gaps are inserted automatically between your signals. You can adjust the timing for your own fist in the menu.Uses International Morse Code:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_codeOther Morse Code standards coming soon!Please note: for security, Morse Straight Key does not have permissions to access the network.\n"},

The workaround is touch the upper part space bar, disable \"improve sensitivity\" if possible, or use a IME that has a bigger space bar.2, No back button and Menu button support, because those feature need root permissions. This could be true for other specific feature.3, This app is not suitable for device that solely use virtual keys.4, This app is not suitable for device with virtual buttons.5, Android 6+ has a new app permission system, when setting permission for an app, no overlay app is allowed. You will get message titled \"Screen overlay detected\" when trying to set app permission. Please open this app and unchecked \"Enable gestures\" temporarily.  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Useful hints: 1, With Android 4.1+, you could even hide the icon in notification pull-down by unchecking \"show notification\" setting for Swipe Home Button in your phone's application manager. On Android 4.0 device, the icon in notification pull-down is required to keep the swipes working.2, Every swipe should start from outside of the screen. The swipe don't need to be fast.3, Because of this app you may need to press upper part of your space bar when typing. The lower part is occupied by this app.4, Combining with other \"Lock Screen\" app can achieve lock screen using swipe.5, Combining with the great app called \"Tasker\", by creating tasker Shortcuts, you could achieve any command with swipe, including \"Menu back\" and \"back button\".\nSwipe Home Button for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

The player must avoid colliding with the terrain and other enemies, while simultaneously maintaining its limited fuel supply which diminishes over time. More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game.The game is divided into six sections, each with a different style of terrain and different obstacles. There is no intermission between each section; the game simply scrolls into the new terrain. Points are awarded based upon the number of seconds of being alive, and on destroying enemies and fuel tanks. In the final section, the player must destroy a \"base\". Once this has been accomplished, a flag denoting a completed mission is posted at the bottom right of the screen.
