With Hola installed you can access websites that are blocked or censored in your country.\nThe Hola browser extension helps you become invisible whilst browsing the web and also provides you with access to restricted resources, Hola can help with both these tasks without requiring any advanced proxy configuration knowledge. The extension sits behind a plain layout, yet it hides a powerful engine. It offers you a simple solution for accessing various blocked websites and enhancing your browsing speed.\nHola's navigation is fairly straightforward; simply pick one of the proxy servers that is provided neatly in the drop-down list. For best results, it is recommended that you pick one that is nearest to your country, as this will give you better browsing speed. After choosing the desired proxy, the extension changes your IP address and unblocks access to the domain.\nOverall, Hola is quite useful for keeping your identity secret, thereby preventing tracking attempts, and it is also a reliable browser extension that helps you visit inaccessible websites. If you view lots of content on the web, then Hola is a great extension to use.\n"},

Since then, Mozilla Firefox has consistently featured in the top 3 most popular browsers globally.

The browser is particularly popular with developers thanks to its open source development and active community of advanced users.\nEasier Browsing\nMozilla put of a lot of resources into creating a simple but effective UI aimed at making browsing quicker and easier. They created the tab structure that has been adopted by most other browsers. In recent years Mozilla has also focused on maximizing browsing area by simplifying toolbar controls to just a Firefox button (which contains settings and options) and back/forward buttons. The URL box features direct Google searching as well as an auto predict/history feature called Awesome Bar. On the right side of the URL box there are bookmarking, history and refresh buttons. To the right of the URL box is a search box which allows you to customize your search engine options. Outside of that a view button controls what you see below the URL. Next to that you have the download history and home buttons.\nSpeed\nMozilla Firefox boasts impressive page load speeds thanks to the excellent JagerMonkey JavaScript engine. Start up speed and graphics rendering are also among the quickest in the market.  Firefox manages complex video and web content using layer-based Direct2D and Driect3D graphics systems. Crash protection ensures only the plugin causing the issue stops working, not the rest of the content being browsed. Reloading the page restarts any affected plugins. The tab system and Awesome Bar have been streamlined to launch/get results very quickly too.\nSecurity\nFirefox was the first browser to introduce a private browsing feature which allows you to use the internet more anonymously and securely.

At its public launch in 2004 Mozilla Firefox was the first browser to challenge Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2019s dominance. Since then, Mozilla Firefox has consistently featured in the top 3 most popular browsers globally. The key features that have made Mozilla Firefox so popular are the simple and effective UI, browser speed and strong security capabilities. The browser is particularly popular with developers thanks to its open source development and active community of advanced users.\nEasier Browsing\nMozilla put of a lot of resources into creating a simple but effective UI aimed at making browsing quicker and easier. They created the tab structure that has been adopted by most other browsers. In recent years Mozilla has also focused on maximizing browsing area by simplifying toolbar controls to just a Firefox button (which contains settings and options) and back/forward buttons. The URL box features direct Google searching as well as an auto predict/history feature called Awesome Bar. On the right side of the URL box there are bookmarking, history and refresh buttons. To the right of the URL box is a search box which allows you to customize your search engine options. Outside of that a view button controls what you see below the URL. Next to that you have the download history and home buttons.\nSpeed\nMozilla Firefox boasts impressive page load speeds thanks to the excellent JagerMonkey JavaScript engine. Start up speed and graphics rendering are also among the quickest in the market.  Firefox manages complex video and web content using layer-based Direct2D and Driect3D graphics systems. Crash protection ensures only the plugin causing the issue stops working, not the rest of the content being browsed. Reloading the page restarts any affected plugins. The tab system and Awesome Bar have been streamlined to launch/get results very quickly too.\nSecurity\nFirefox was the first browser to introduce a private browsing feature which allows you to use the internet more anonymously and securely. History, searches, passwords, downloads, cookies and cached content are all removed on shutdown. Minimizing the chances of another user stealing your identity or finding confidential information.  Content security, anti-phishing technology and antivirus/anti-malware integration ensures your browsing experience is as safe as possible.\nPersonalisation & Development\nOne of the best features of the Firefox UI is customization. Simply right click on the navigation toolbar to customize individual components or just drag and drop items you want to move around. The inbuilt Firefox Add-ons Manager allows you to discover and install add-ons within the browser as well as view ratings, recommendations and descriptions.  Read about the top recommended add-ons for Mozilla Firefox on TechBeat. Thousands of customizable themes allow you to customize the look and feel of your browser. Site authors and developers can create advanced content and applications using Mozilla\u2019s open source platform and enhanced API.\nLooking for the Mac version of Firefox?

"\nGoogle\u2019s game changing browser Chrome for Mac combines sophisticated technology with a simple UI, to create a faster, safer and easier browsing experience. Google\u2019s rapid and continuous development cycle ensures Chrome for Mac continues to close in on Safari's dominant position in the Mac browser market.\nSpeed\nWe thought Firefox was good but Chrome not only beats it for speed, it also takes less strain on Mac CPU. Which means not only will your browsing be quicker, but so too will other applications you're running at the same time. Google Chrome launches extremely quickly, runs applications at speed thanks to a powerful JavaScript engine and loads pages rapidly using the WebKit open source rendering engine. Add to this quicker search and navigation options from the simplified UI and you have a browser that is damn hard to beat on speed.\nClean, simple UI\nWhile this was a revolutionary area for PC users, Mac users were already used to slimline looking browsers thanks to Safari. We think Chrome improved on this further though - the simple UI hasn\u2019t changed much since the beta launch in 2008. Google focused on trimming down unnecessary toolbar space to maximise browsing real estate. The browser is made up of 3 rows of tools, the top layer horizontally stacks automatically adjusting tabs, next to a simple new tabs icon and the standard minimize, expand & close windows controls. The middle row includes 3 navigation controls (Back, Forward & Stop/Refresh), a URL box which also allows direct Google web searching and a star bookmarking icon. Extensions and browser settings icons line up to the right of the URL box. The third row is made up of bookmark folders and installed apps. Easily overlooked now, this clean UI was a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded toolbars of popular browsers pre-2008.\nPrivacy\nAnother hugely popular feature, Incognito mode allows you to browse privately by disabling history recording, reducing traceable breadcrumbs and removing tracking cookies on shutdown. Chrome\u2019s settings also allow you to customize regular browsing privacy preferences.\nSecurity\nChrome\u2019s Sandboxing prevents malware automatically installing on your Mac or affecting other browser tabs. Chrome also has Safe Browsing technology built in with malware and phishing protection that warns you if you encounter a website suspected of containing malicious software/activity. Regular automatic updates ensure security features are up to date and effective.\nCustomization\nA vast selection of apps, extensions, themes and settings make your browsing experience unique to you. Improve productivity, security, navigation speed, pretty much anything you can think of with apps and extensions from the Google Chrome Store. Install themes created by top artists or make your own using mychrometheme.com. Sign in with your Google Account to back up your contacts, preferences, history as well as access all your Google tools with a single login.\nThe program provider has restricted distribution of older versions of this product. FileHippo apologises for any inconvenience caused.\n"},

At its public launch in 2004 Mozilla Firefox was the first browser to challenge Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2019s dominance. Since then, Mozilla Firefox has consistently featured in the top 3 most popular browsers globally. The key features that have made Mozilla Firefox so popular are the simple and effective UI, browser speed and strong security capabilities. The browser is particularly popular with developers thanks to its open source development and active community of advanced users.\nEasier Browsing\nMozilla put of a lot of resources into creating a simple but effective UI aimed at making browsing quicker and easier. They created the tab structure that has been adopted by most other browsers. In recent years Mozilla has also focused on maximizing browsing area by simplifying toolbar controls to just a Firefox button (which contains settings and options) and back/forward buttons. The URL box features direct Google searching as well as an auto predict/history feature called Awesome Bar. On the right side of the URL box there are bookmarking, history and refresh buttons. To the right of the URL box is a search box which allows you to customize your search engine options. Outside of that a view button controls what you see below the URL. Next to that you have the download history and home buttons.\nSpeed\nMozilla Firefox boasts impressive page load speeds thanks to the excellent JagerMonkey JavaScript engine. Start up speed and graphics rendering are also among the quickest in the market.  Firefox manages complex video and web content using layer-based Direct2D and Driect3D graphics systems. Crash protection ensures only the plugin causing the issue stops working, not the rest of the content being browsed. Reloading the page restarts any affected plugins. The tab system and Awesome Bar have been streamlined to launch/get results very quickly too.\nSecurity\nFirefox was the first browser to introduce a private browsing feature which allows you to use the internet more anonymously and securely. History, searches, passwords, downloads, cookies and cached content are all removed on shutdown. Minimizing the chances of another user stealing your identity or finding confidential information.  Content security, anti-phishing technology and antivirus/anti-malware integration ensures your browsing experience is as safe as possible.\nPersonalisation & Development\nOne of the best features of the Firefox UI is customization. Simply right click on the navigation toolbar to customize individual components or just drag and drop items you want to move around. The inbuilt Firefox Add-ons Manager allows you to discover and install add-ons within the browser as well as view ratings, recommendations and descriptions.  Read about the top recommended add-ons for Mozilla Firefox on TechBeat. Thousands of customizable themes allow you to customize the look and feel of your browser.

combines sophisticated technology with a simple UI, to create a faster, safer and easier browsing experience. Launched in 2008, Google Chrome quickly dominated the browser market to become the most used browser globally within 4 years of its public release. Google\u2019s rapid and continuous development cycle ensures the browser continues to compete with the other most popular and advanced web browsers available.\nSpeed\nPerhaps the area Google invested most of its development time to differentiate from other browsers. Google Chrome launches extremely quickly from your desktop, runs applications at speed thanks to a powerful JavaScript engine and loads pages rapidly using the WebKit open source rendering engine. Add to this quicker search and navigation options from the simplified UI and you have a browser that is pretty hard to beat on speed, especially if gaming is your thing. \nClean, simple UI\nGoogle Chrome\u2019s most striking feature and a substantial factor in its popularity - the simple UI hasn\u2019t changed much since the beta launch in 2008. Google focused on trimming down unnecessary toolbar space to maximise browsing real estate. The browser is made up of 3 rows of tools, the top layer horizontally stacks automatically adjusting tabs, next to a simple new tabs icon and the standard minimize, expand & close windows controls. The middle row includes 3 navigation controls (Back, Forward & Stop/Refresh), a URL box which also allows direct Google web searching and a star bookmarking icon. Extensions and browser settings icons line up to the right of the URL box. The third row is made up of bookmark folders and installed apps. Easily overlooked now, this clean UI was a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded toolbars of popular browsers pre-2008.\nPrivacy\nAnother hugely popular feature, Incognito mode allows you to browse privately by disabling history recording, reducing traceable breadcrumbs and removing tracking cookies on shutdown. Chrome\u2019s settings also allow you to customize regular browsing privacy preferences.\nSecurity\nChrome\u2019s Sandboxing prevents malware automatically installing on your computer or affecting other browser tabs. Chrome also has Safe Browsing technology built in with malware and phishing protection that warns you if you encounter a website suspected of containing malicious software/activity. Regular automatic updates ensure security features are up to date and effective.\nCustomization\nA vast selection of apps, extensions, themes and settings make your browsing experience unique to you. Improve productivity, security, navigation speed, pretty much anything you can think of with apps and extensions from the Google Chrome Store. Install themes created by top artists or make your own using mychrometheme.com. Sign in with your Google Account to back up your contacts, preferences, history as well as access all your Google tools with a single login.\nThe program provider has restricted distribution of older versions of this product. FileHippo apologises for any inconvenience caused.\nLooking for the Mac version of Google Chrome?

Piriform\u2019s CCleaner is a quick and easy to use program which makes your Mac faster and more secure.

Rapid 1 click analysis and cleaning settings make CCleaner a very easy way to improve your Mac performance quickly. Some of Windows features are missing - the Uninstaller, Drive Wiper and Tools, probably due to Apple's sandboxing.\nA Faster Computer\nBrowsing the internet your computer picks up a whole host of unnecessary files, cookies and history.

CCleaner removes these unused files and settings to free up valuable hard drive space, enabling your system to run faster.

The military grade Drive Wiper ensures any data you want to be permanently deleted, stays deleted.\nCustomisable Cleaning\nCCleaner Tools and Options tabs allow you to customise cleaning options to fit your needs.

The clean, intuitive UI makes it one of the easiest programs to use, but don\u2019t let its size and simplicity fool you. This is a powerful utility for improving your Mac's performance. Piriform\u2019s regular update process means CCleaner is constantly improving and its popularity will continue to grow.\n"},

It runs on Windows NT 4 and higher and its output lists Registry and file system API discrepancies that may indicate the presence of a user-mode or kernel-mode rootkit.\nRootkitRevealer successfully detects many persistent rootkits including AFX, Vanquish and HackerDefender (note: RootkitRevealer is not intended to detect rootkits like Fu that don't attempt to hide their files or registry keys).\nSince persistent rootkits work by changing API results so that a system view using APIs differs from the actual view in storage, RootkitRevealer compares the results of a system scan at the highest level with that at the lowest level. The highest level is the Windows API and the lowest level is the raw contents of a file system volume or Registry hive (a hive file is the Registry's on-disk storage format).\nThus, rootkits, whether user mode or kernel mode, that manipulate the Windows API or native API to remove their presence from a directory listing, for example, will be seen by RootkitRevealer as a discrepancy between the information returned by the Windows API and that seen in the raw scan of a FAT or NTFS volume's file system structures.\n"},

{"name": "CrococryptMirror Portable", "link": "http://filehippo.com/download_crococrypt-mirror-portable/", "appVersions": {}, "author": "Hissen IT", "description": "\n\r\nCrococryptMirror is a rather useful and easy to use portable encryption application tool. CrococryptMirror can easily encrypt your important and confidential directories with ease and mixes high grade encryption with simple but extremely effective processes.\r\n\n\r\nThe software works by mirroring the content of the folders you want to encrypt into an encoded container, which can then only be decrypted by using the CrococryptMirror tool, which is password protected. As well as being very secure, this also means you can effectively hide encrypted folders and data in plain sight from prying eyes. Additionally, a ZIP compression for storage space optimization is used. Mirroring can either be done manually (on-demand) or by using the included sync service which detects directory changes on the fly. \r\n\n\r\nAs you would expect from an an encryption tool, the encryption protocols are high end, using both AES and Twofish (256 bits, cascading) algorithms.  The keyfile is secured by a password of your choice, using PKCS #5 (PBKDF2) with a SHA512/Whirlpool based HMAC using 100000 iterations and also AES and Twofish. Basically, that means it's secure. We would advise against using \u2018Password.\u2019  \u201812345\u2019 or \u2018[insert child\u2019s name here]\u2019 as your password though. You still need to have a good password to get the most out of Crococrypt. But, as an extra layer of security, your encrypted files can only be accessed using the Crococrypt software.\r\n\n\r\nFor anyone who just read that and went, \u2018huh, what?\u2019 CrococryptMirror  is very good at securing your data and is next to impossible to hack, crack and/or steal it. It\u2019s also easy to use. \r\n\n\nKey Features: \r\nCopying and synchronizing of files/folders/directories (recursively) to encrypted folders.\nAES and Twofish (256 bits, cascading) encryption protocols.\nEncryption of filenames.\nSource folders can be stored in multiple destination containers at the same time (e.g., USB disk drive and Cloud storage).\nMaster password protected.\nNetwork drives can be used as sources and destinations.\nExplorer view to read encrypted containers.\n\n\n\r\nThis version of CrococryptMirror  is portable, which means not only can you carry it around on a USB stick or on your phone, etc, it doesn\u2019t need to be installed, and can be launched from whatever media you have it stored on. You can also store and use CrococryptMirror  from a network drive or cloud storage.\r\n\n\r\nCrococryptMirror is also 100% Freeware without a catch, and there\u2019s no registration, activation, trial period, or adverts and it has no limitations. It\u2019s also really good at what it does; and by that we don\u2019t mean it\u2019s good because it\u2019s free, we just mean it\u2019s good.\r\n\n"},

{"name": "HMA! Pro VPN for Mac", "link": "http://filehippo.com/mac/download_hma-pro-vpn-for-mac/", "appVersions": {}, "author": "Privax Ltd", "description": "\n\r\nHMA! Pro VPN for Mac is a leading internet encryption service based on virtual private network technology. Whilst VPN\u2019s are predominantly used to remotely connect people to localized computer networks, the underlying security advantages in the form of encryption can be used to provide online security and privacy services.  Consumers and businesses connect to HMA\u2019s worldwide VPN servers to tunnel their internet connections through HMA's servers to achieve increased security and privacy. \r\n\nMain reason for use:\r\n\nInternet security:\r\nCustomers connect to the service to encrypt their internet connection; this encryption prevents hackers and network snoops from being able to intercept their sensitive internet traffic. This is commonly used for open Wi\u2013Fi networks.\nCensorship:\r\nSimilar to a web proxy, customers use HMA\u2019s VPN service to bypass internet censorship. VPN\u2019s are far more flexible compared to a web proxy as they tunnel the entire internet connection and not just your web browser traffic. As a result, there are never any rendering issues because there is no parsing of HMTL/JS,  and all content will function as it should do (e.g. Flash). Speed will also be faster because of a larger network of servers in 190+ countries, and the ability to setup VPN connections on your actual router means third-party devices are able to bypass censorship without any additional configuration required.\nAnonymity and Privacy:\r\nIn like manner to a web proxy, the VPN service is also a hit for customers who wish to gain a measure of anonymity on the internet and also protect their identity and privacy. However, unlike a web proxy, the VPN service affects all applications on your computer, not just your web browser. This, therefore, enables users to protect their entire internet connection and not just their web browser traffic.\nTechnical:\r\nHMA utilizes various VPN technologies such as OpenVPN (UDP/TCP), PPTP and L2TP/IPSec. Each VPN server has a set number of IP addresses; each time a customer connects to one of HMA\u2019s VPN servers, they are assigned a sheared IP address. HMA does not NAT customer connections, meaning the total amount of simultaneous connections they can support is the total amount of IP addresses that they offer, which is 2,800 + IP addresses.\n\n\n\r\nAlong with HMA! Pro VPN for Mac, there is also a GUI client for Windows as well, and there is a command line client provided for the Linux community. Mobile users are not left out either, with apps for Android and iOS available via the Google Play and Apple App Store.\r\n\n\r\nHMA! Pro VPN is also one of the only VPNs on the market to offer multiple languages - it is now available in French, Italian, German, Spanish and Turkish.\r\n\nHMA! offers market-leading coverage, with well over 760+ servers in 280+ locations across 210 countries providing more than 280,000 active subscribers with over 2,800 + IP address choices.  Users will also benefit from excellent 24/7 technical support from HMA!\u2019s dedicated customer service team.\r\n\nLooking for the Windows version of HMA! Pro VPN? Download Here\n"},
